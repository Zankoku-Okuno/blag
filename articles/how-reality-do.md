# How Reality Do

Here I'm collecting my thoughts on what it is to be reality and what out consciousness' relation with it is.
Bear in mind that this stuff has been hotly contested from time immemorial.
That is, I'm merely writing this stuff down, not really convinced of it, and I certainly don't expect anyone else to be either.


## Foundations

Whenever I reach the foundations of a field, I find that there are multiple formulations of the foundations, and some of them are mutually exclusive.
Importantly, this holds for mathematics and logic, two fields considered by laypeople to be absolute.
The annoying thing is that belief is ultimately a matter of unrestricted choice.
More accurately, the only restriction is external to the theory: what will the audience be willing to accept?

Audiences that understand this fact (i.e. logicians and mathematicians) tend to ignore belief, and just work within the proposed system.
However, they are only willing to go so far: no logician will listen if you are using an inconsistent logic.
However, the difference between an inconsistent and any other kind of logic is still just what the audience will accept.
After all, if an inconsistent logic happened to be true, then there would be no property it lacked relative to a consistent logic.


## Possible Worlds

Whenever an idea uses "closest possible world", I am immediately unconvinced.
Notions of closest require notions of closeness, which requires a metric.
I have yet to see a metricization of the space of possible worlds.

Even the space (without a metric) of possible worlds is always implicitly assumed rather than properly defined.
Whenever an idea uses "possible worlds", I am immediately wary.
If the space of possible worlds is qualified (i.e. possible assuming this physical/logical theory), then it's fine.
When the governing assumption is not given, then I am comfortable using 'impossible' worlds.
After all, there are many choices of logic, and some^[the vast majority, I think] of them are inconsistent (i.e. allow for impossible worlds).
More often, though, people ignore possible worlds for mere expediency.


## The Simulation is Real

Baudrillard is not concerned with people living in a simulation.
He assumes that humans perceive reality and confuse their perceptions of reality with the reality itself, and that trend isn't only at the personal level, but also translates up to a society.
The simulation he writes about comes from within the people trapped by it, and there is no escape into reality, only into a different perception; it is not imposed externally by camouflaged alien overlords, and there is no red pill.
That is why "the simulation is real": it's the only thing we can have.


## Belief-In

For some time, I've been curious what it means to believe-in.
This seems like a question that really should be addressed before claiming to believe in a religion.

Importantly, the difference between belief-in and believe-that is not a matter of susceptibility to reason and quantifiable experience.
A belief that God exists is different from a belief in God, even if the god under investigation is omni-inscrutable^[inaccessible to all mortal investigation].
Interestingly, I've questioned whether God is lying about his own existence.
It may not be necessary to believe that an entity exists in order to believe in that entity.

One thing is certain, belief-in is not scientific belief.
For me --- who has spent nearly their entire life interested only in scientific and mathematical fact --- it can be difficult to imagine another form of believe existing.
Nevertheless, as I have recently grokked, literary analysis is not trying to be a scientific theory of linguistic aesthetics.
A literary theory is one of many roads to understanding a literary work --- works that are open to infinite interpretation.
The more theories an author/reader can deploy, the better.
This is in stark contrast to scientific theories, where the entire scientific community is attempting to converge on a single description of physical reality.

If theology functions as a way to find something that isn't knowledge --- maybe something like perspective, goals, or meaning --- then why would we even try to hold it to scientific standards or use it in scientific contexts?
