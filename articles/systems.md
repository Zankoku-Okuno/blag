# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I design and track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Some Guiding Inspiration

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.

A review is not just a list of accomplishments and shortcomings;
it is an opportunity to choose what to highlight.
The quality of that choice will affect the quality of further action.

If being an executive means not having anywhere else to pass the blame to, then the life of an executive is about making significant decisions, living with the outcomes, striving to make better choices, and not relying on luck or privilege.


## Major Patterns

Unfortunately, I do not have enough experience to be able to create a good theory for either the necessities of life organization or the available tools that can help accomplish it.
Instead, I will resort to a running list of thought patterns that seem to be used often.

### Timescales

Each sort of action has a natural timescale, and some actions can exist at several scales.
I am currently using daily, weekly, and monthly timescales.
As I expand my cycles of action, seasonal and yearly scales will become more important.

### Focus
### Reminders
### Priorities

### Review

Without a review of my actions, I am essentially in the dark about my capacity for success (and conversely my risk of failure).
My review system is currently an ad-hoc personal introspection more than anything else.
I have recently learned some about debriefing; it seems to have a good value-to-complexity ratio and so would like to begin integrating it.


I seem to have developed an introspective system.
It is a regular system, repeating on seasonal and yearly timescales.
It essentially consists of me asking myself why I am feeling particularly good or bad at any given time.
In response to this, I attempt to find events or patterns in my life that could serve as contributors.
I tend to focus more on questions than answers.
As long as I look at the questions regularly enough, I can keep my mind looking for related data.
It is important not to jump too early to conclusions, but once an answer becomes shockingly clear, it is worth noting.
If a question fades into the background, that is probably an indication that to originating problem has become less important, and that it is not worth spending extra time on.

My introspection also includes a time set aside to ask "Of what I've done today, what was important to me?".
I write this down on my calendar as a reminder that I am doing things I care about.


The process of debriefing has been explained to me as the process of answering five questions after the completion of a task:
  * What happened?
  * What went right?
  * What went wrong?
  * Why?
  * What can we learn from it?
Importantly, the questions do not ask "who" questions: "who" questions tend to introduce recrimination-based biases and distractions.
The process should not take up to much time relative to the planning and execution phases of a task.

It is a testament to the system's simplicity and coherence that I can remember it despite not employing it or attempting to memorize it.
It's simplicity is also a contributor to its flexibility.
It seems possible to apply debriefing to any clearly-defined task.

I do have some questions about debriefing that I should pay attention to as I integrate the method.
  * Is there always something that went wrong/right?
    Smaller tasks, there might not be much room for things to go unexpectedly well/poorly.
    More abstract tasks might suffer from a horizon effect: the consequences of the actions are too far in the future to know their value.
  * How does "Why?" differ from "What can we learn?"
    Is it the identification vs. potential solution of problems?
  * Where is there room in this framework for hypotheses?
    It seems that finished answers are being asked for, but complex tasks may have uncertainties in the answers that need later follow-up.
  * How are lessons learned searched for applicability to new tasks?

### Lifecycles

I am trying to categorize how ideas, notes, tasks, and so on make it from conception to artifact (or dismissal).
These are currently only rough notes.

Something that is currently an issue are TODO notes.
They, by definition require follow-up, but I have no system in place for following through on that.
The same applies to my bug trackers.

#### Follow-Up

Follow-up begins in an _inbox_.
The inbox should be reviewed regularly.
From here, a note can be _retired_ or move to _alive_

The set of _alive_ notes should be kept small.
When that set grows too big, it should be reviewed.
From here, a note can be _retired_ or _archived_.

The set of _archived_ notes can be large, but should mostly be kept out of sight.
Archived notes should each have a small chance of appearing alongside _alive_ notes.
When that happens, there is an opportunity to move the note back to _alive_, or to _retire_ it.

Notes that are _retired_ should be kept entirely out of sight.
Strictly speaking, a record of them is unnecessary.

#### Tasks

Tasks begin as a _proposal_.
Proposals should be reviewed regularly.
Tasks which are immediately actionable should be moved to the _priority list_.
A proposal which is "too large" should be moved to _decomposition_.
If a proposal is not moved during review, it should be marked with a date for future review.

A task undergoing _decomposition_ is broken up into smaller tasks.
The newly-created tasks begin as a _proposal_ as normal.
The new tasks also track their "parent" task.
When decomposition is complete, the task moves to _milestones_.

Tasks in the _priority list_ should be ranked against each other based on importance, time-to-completion, cost, and deadline.
Tasks should be taken from the priority list to determine focus at various timescales.
This does not move the tasks; they are simply copied into a separate (linked) system.
When a task is completed, it should be moved into the _review_ stage.

Tasks in the _review_ stage should be reviewed quickly after their entrance into it.
From here, notes for review can be created.
Further, if completion of the task revealed additional tasks, these should be created just as in decomposition, except that I'm not sure if the new tasks should have a parent, and if so, where.
Once a task has been reviewed, it is _complete_.

A _milestone_ task tracks its child tasks.
Additional children can be created for the milestone.
Once all children are complete (some may be dismissed), the milestone task also moves to complete.

A _complete_ task need no longer be seen.
Strictly, a record of the task is unnecessary.

Tasks may be _dismissed_ at any point.
Dismissed tasks should remain out of sight, but may be restored to their previous state.
When a task is dismissed, its children should also be dismissed; likewise when restored.


### Forms of Notes

I am accumulating a massive amount of notes and am struggling to use them.
It seems there are several forms of notes, and that they need to be segregated into their systems tailored to each form.

For now, small notes are mostly being tossed into `okuno.info/notes` but not dealt with.
Actionable notes are being put into the dashboard, especially those with a date attached.
A number of notes are pointers into journals for later follow-up: those are going onto loose-leaf.
Notes for larger projects are a mess.
Reminders and repeating tasks share some similarities with notes, but have to be managed very differently.
Even reminders vs. repeating tasks may need differing management strategies.
I am managing checklists manually for now.

There are number of writing- and academia-related forms of notes that I am accumulating here:
  * approach, i.e. design methodology
  * epigram or idea with citation
  * study/analysis notes
  * academic draft fragments
  * opinion
  * style guide
  * hypotheses
  * questions & proposed answers
  * puzzles
  * definitions/reference
  * reflection

## Improvement

  * Better ways to search tasks:
    1. filter by size (e.g. I only have a little time vs. I can make progress on something large),
    2. dismiss a tag,
    3. attach an `x` button to action item descriptors that hides every item with that descriptor,
    4. button that resets all filters,
    5. view a project without activating it.
    
  * Reduce the number of things I have to do to get something into okuno.info:
    1. create new tags with a new action item,
    2. mission statement should be optional,
    3. get layout on the page to work on mobile.
    
  * Improved action item data:
    1. when putting an item into waiting mode, allow for a date to be set when the item will re-appear,
    2. allow monetary costs for items.
    
  * item dependencies
    
  * A system of review is fundamental to successful operation of any planning system.
    
  * Merge all email streams together.
    
  * Improve soundscape:
    1. organize music,
    2. review music on phone,
    3. obtain white noise/ambient music,
    4. optimize alarm sounds.
    
  * Seasonalism means to focus on different things through the year:
      * Spring to explore  --- learn new tools and generate new ideas
      * Summer to develop  --- adopt better tools and robustify existing artifacts
      * Autumn to analyze  --- take an inventory of tools and systems
      check systems, tools, & artifacts to see if they are working or not working and where they can be improved
      * Winter to organize --- take inventory of the ideas, plan their direction, and perform cleanup
    
  * Improved tooling for journaling, writing tutorials and essays:
    1. notes database,
    2. drafts technology or system,
    3. fundamentals of inscription.


## Notes on Tooling

Look at the "Things 3" app for a minimalist to-do system.

Scheduled tasks vs. travel: notifications must handle using timezoned time vs. local time intelligently.

The killer feature of to-do systems is to hide things that are not immediately actionable.
