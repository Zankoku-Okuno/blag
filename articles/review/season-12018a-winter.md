# Review Winter 12018

## Introspection

This season was driven by getting ready for the future.
After creating the blag, I attempted to document my systems thinking it would be an easy task... it was not.
It became clear that my system was ill-optimized for various tasks, even the task of understanding my needs.
I ended up^[I can't deny The Pen Addict podcast's aid and abetting in this] using more paper in my systems.
That has lead to more rapid prototyping, free from the restrictions of the existing app ecosystem, and to filling needs I didn't know I had when I set out.

My sense of the season is one of slow, grinding achievement.
It's obvious that have have plenty of big plans, but to get there I will need to clear out some smaller ones.
I think I am getting good experience in managing my projects, and that comes not only from taking on week- to month-long tasks, but also from managing two other programmers at work.


## Systems

### Journaling

Let's start with the largest new system by weight: journaling.
Starting at the end of January, I began a twice-daily journal regimen and completed 96 out of 116 (82%) of planned entries.
That may not sound great, but bear in mind that I have never before kept a journal for more than two days, with the exception of my 2008 Japan travel diary, which only lasted half the planned time.
There was no plan for the content, except that should be written without a plan for the future of the content.

The journal does seem to be flexing my writing voice more.
Sentences are coming to me a little more easily, and require less cleanup afterwards.
I am also becoming more experienced in noticing resistance^[a.k.a. writer's block] and defeating it.
Despite having no hopes for the content, several entries have ideas (or the entire entry) plucked from them for use in the blag, academic writing, or notes.

At the start, I expected more benefit to my fiction writing, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen any time soon.
To be honest, a twice-daily rate turned out to be a chore, especially with the relatively rigid schedule.
In the last three weeks, the entry schedule slipped noticeably.
I can't rule out that I may have given up in part after a week averaging only one entry a day.
It is possible that the drop may have been caused by an increase in other forms of system.
Weekends are particularly difficult as there is no set timeframe---either to start or to end.

My plan for the next journal is to be lighter, more flexible, and more forgiving.
The goal will be to hit 80-100% success at one entry per day, and lower than 80% will trigger additional focus rather than despair.
I've also placed a list of prompts at the front of my journal for reference if I get stuck.
Finally, for weekend entries I've set a reminder, and will set a timer within which the bulk of the entry will need to be made or else abandoned.

### Midori

My daily task list began on loose-leaf paper and inevitably got dirty, crumpled, in my way, or not at-hand.
After flirting with a clipboard, I realized I'm a sucker for anything named "Midori", and got myself a Midori Traveller's Notebook.
The notebook is filled with three inserts:
  * long-term planning, checklists
  * daily task lists, week-/month-term notes
  * journal

This system is small, manipulable, and naturally organized, even in a long-term future.
Writing down monthly tracks has lead to an unexpectedly large improvement in my sense of schedule.
The Bullet Journal-based organization I've adopted (mostly the index) has allowed me to freely experiment with new systems when I find a gap in my current tools.
A particular success is that I now have a place for checklists.

There are improvements that could be made to the physical notebook.
The lack of an effective pen loop means I carry my pens separately.
Even though I cycle through many pens, it is sometimes useful to store one pen temporarily when I have to pick up and move in the middle of some writing.
The single bookmark that comes with the notebook is insufficient for the three inserts.

### Review

This season, I spent a lot of time in review and idea garbage collection.
At first that was reasonable: if you're like me^[yes, I am applying the Copernican principle here], you have a lot of ideas for things to do, and it's far easier to have the idea than to follow through on it.
Within a few weeks, it was clear that I was spending too much of my time in garbage collection.

The obvious upside of a review system is that I am no longer losing notes.
It helps my mental state in much the same way as having only a few things in my email inbox.
I no longer have to search through old notes to find what I'm interested in, which means I'm much more likely to follow up on ideas.

The downside is that it takes time to do garbage collection.
As more systems were introduced, garbage collection began to take longer since there were more sources for notes to come from.
As is well-known in editing, having too much footage is a worse problem than having too little.
At the same time, my digital archiving systems were (and still are) not ready for the task of absorbing that information in an ordered way.

To combat the time crunch, I took two major actions.
First, I implemented a note-to-self feature on okuno.info that absorbs small ideas that don't stand on their own but may be integrated into larger ideas in the future.
This feature has certainly eased my garbage collection, but it is an incomplete feature and it is therefore becoming another unsorted inbox.
Second, I cut back on the effort I put into garbage collection, both timing and revision.
I cut back a little too far, however: it was difficult to accumulate my thoughts about March because I was not moving my notes into a review draft.

I already feel better about the amount of time I'm using in garbage collection.
I will go back to taking review notes on a weekly basis as part of garbage collection.
The larger thing is that I will need to stop being afraid of updating okuno.info and add tools to review my notes.
It may also be useful to find a more set format for my reviews, though that should likely grow out of more experience.

### Focus

This season saw the introduction of weekly and monthly focus.
The intent is to have a list of things I would like to stay interested in throughout a timescale.
Mostly, I am using weekly and monthly timescales, though technically I do have a yearly focus, mostly composed of items from last year's review.

More often than not, the items in my focus are checked off.
My January focus was stunningly successful: once I had found my research question, I did zero programming or academic writing on other subjects.
March was also successful, though it doesn't feel like it since it was less ambitious.
February, on the other hand, was essentially a complete failure.
My original focus turned out to feel more like a chore than fun, I took too long to realize that, and by the time I had a second focus, social obligations got in the way of acting on the new plan.

Given the mixed results, I think I need to understand the strategy better and find the right approach.
Should it be kept small and focused?
Should it be more or less of a commitment?
Should it be approached less like a task list?
Should it be built only after I've found a muse?, after I've put it into the context of my life goals?


## Actions

When I went through what I was able to accomplish this winter, I was surprised by the amount of stuff I actually did.

First and foremost, I was able to get serious work done on abstract binding grammars.
This work lays the foundation for further language design ideas, especially continuations.
The work I did there also serves as practice for research, note-taking, and a more self-aware form of academic writing.
When I've previously left off projects in the middle, I wasn't expecting not to come back quickly.
This time around, I deliberately left the work and took additional care to document the ideas that when into it.
With luck, I'll be in a good place when I do come back to it.

On the programming side, I was able to add a notes feature to okuno.info, though it isn't complete.
Honestly, after adding the feature I'm embarrassed that I was so fearful of doing it.
It turned out to only be a day or two of work.
I expect my planned improvements will be likewise easy, though I unfortunately seem to have the same fear as before.
I also ported my blag to Haskell.
Though this doesn't given me much more in the way of features, it does open up possibilities that weren't present in the static version of the site.

I was able to grind down some more mundane things as well.
I helped with my sister's wedding and swapping their room with the office.
I followed up on banking weirdness after my card info was stolen and renewed my passport before it expired.
None of that particularly advances my life goals, but it's the usual real life stuff that I would normally forget about or postpone until it became a real hassle.

My systems received some development work.
My journaling was successful, and I put together a notebook to manage my task lists and focuses.
The notebook in particular had no small amount of design work done for it.
Though some details have evolved with use, the overall design has turned out to be valid.

Finally, I was able to reduce the amount of undeveloped content for my blag.
Part of that was that my March focus encouraged doing work on the blag.
Another part of that may be that my journal developed my writing skills, even if it was only to be more comfortable creating sentences.
The final part was that I was able to get the work organized.
I did have "feature" branches from the start of the blag, but I developed that inventory system far more.
All of those branches were turned into pull requests so that they didn't get lost in the spaghetti of the branch timeline.
Once that was in place, I also marked the PRs as to which ones were closer to completion so that I could better focus on articles that required less work to complete.


## Analysis

  * **Long term view, short-term projects.**
    I've been thinking a fair bit about what my long term goals are, and I keep coming back to teaching.
    What I'd like to find is a way to try my hand at teaching before going through more school.
    On the other hand, I find myself consumed by clearing small projects out of my way.
    This may turn out to be a year of mental decluttering before embarking on the road to professorship.
    I was thinking about "He who knows does not speak, he who is ignorant does": perhaps it's that one must speak to turn from student to master, and my blag is a part of that process.
    At the very least, I hope it allows me to grow into larger projects.
  * **Ideas are a denial-of-service attack.**
    A small idea can take much longer to explore or explain.
    Even at a rate of one idea a day, trying to develop each one fully would only leave me with a pile of unfinished work.
    Therefore, I will always have to throw away ideas and plans.
    This is something like the problem of having too much footage, which presents a worse problem to an editor than having too little.
  * **There's only so much time I can save by not getting distracted.**
    I'm not yet sure how else to create time, other than getting practiced at working faster.
    I should be careful of this one, as it could easily be twisted into an excuse for slacking.

Something that has been bugging me this season is categorizing my actions.
I think a serious improvement to okuno.info requires understanding how to navigate a pool of actions quickly.
In particular, the way that taking an action relates to the passage of time seems very useful for understanding how schedules have to be flexible.
As yet, I have been unable to remember to use these as a prospective tool.
I've gone ahead and just reproduced some notes here for future reference:
  * Perfective: complete within a fixed (if unknown) time frame.
  * Free^[they are free to take over you, rather than you are free to take or leave them]: expand to fill all available time.
  * Inertial: once begun, it is difficult to stop.
  * High Activation Energy^[This needs a much better name]: difficult to begin (usually due to fear of the unknown).

There are a few things I think deserve some follow-up through the year.

  * Why am I so afraid of touching the code for okuno.info?
    Note-to-self is failing due to lack of review.
    Review is not happening because I haven't implemented tagging and searching.
    That implementation isn't happening because I don't want to mess with the okuno.info code base.
    The strange thing is, I've already proven to myself how easy that process actually is once I sit down to do it.
  * Am I reading enough books? ---
    I might have been avoiding books unnecessarily in February.
    I perhaps could have felt better about that month if I had just picked a book up off my tsundoku.
  * Read [Triggers](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/66) ---
    Speaking of reading books, this could be a very good read.
    Cortex certainly recommends it, and the basic strategy seems to be sound to turn good thought into good instinct.

Something that is consuming my long-term goals at the moment is teaching.
I feel like I'm not ready to begin pursuing that quite yet, but the goal is now quite obvious.
I think it may be 12019 that I start looking into what it takes to pursue something like a PhD, or educational video or whatever.
