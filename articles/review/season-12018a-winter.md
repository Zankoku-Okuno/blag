# Review Winter 12018


There's only so much time you can save by not getting distracted.
A better way to optimize time usage is to get more out of the same amount of time.

This season, I spent a lot of time in review and idea garbage collection.
At first that was reasonable: if you're like me^[yes, i am applying the Copernican principle here], you have a lot of ideas for things to do, and its' far easier to have the idea than to follow through on it.
Within a few weeks, it was clear that I was spending too much of my time in garbage collection.
As is well-known in editing, having too much footage is a worse problem than having too little.


Before learning something, take ~3 sentences to state your life goals.
Once complete, take ~3 sentences to say how what you're learning connects to those goals.
Apparently, this increases the effectiveness of learning, likely by adding motivation.
An additional benefit might be noticing that some particular fields of learning are not relevant, and therefore distractions.

Converses and inverses are useful tools.
In science, it's useful to try to falsify as well as verify.
When investigating agency, try reversing the flow of choice.
The learning goals technique above seems to move the review ahead of the task.
These suggest a meta-principle: try tweaking principles with converses and inverses to explore different possible principles and compare to the original.
That's going to take judgment and a good bit of charitable flexibility.

I've been thinking about broad categories of actions and how they impact scheduling.
  * Perfective: complete within a fixed (if unknown) time frame.
  * Free: expand to fill all available time.
  * Inertial: once begun, it is difficult to stop.
  * High Activation Energy: difficult to begin (usually due to fear of the unknown).
I think a small list like this is more effective than knowing/guessing particular amounts of time.
No arithmetic is required, and the categories feel like linguistic aspect, so the system can be used without tools.
As yet, I have been unable to remember to use these as a prospective tool.


I started journaling this season.
It started as twice-daily, but I'm going to move to a less frequent and more flexible schedule for the spring.
Instituting debriefing will take up some of the work that the journal was doing (that means I have to actually start a debriefing system).
The journal, by contrast, will deal less with specifics of my tasks, and more with introspection and the removal of idea-crack.
To maintain a flexible schedule without succumbing to a slippery slope, I am going to track how many journal entries I make during a week.
The goal will be to hit between 80% and 100% one entry per day, and lower than 80% will have trigger additional focus rather than despair.
I'd also like to experiment with writing something small, set, and easy every day alongside the entry as a way to keep the journal in mind.


I now have a place to put checklists.
That seems to be helping organize review, but possibly also removing some flexibility.

  * Read [Triggers](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/66) --- could help turn good thought into good instinct.
  * Ideas are a denial-of-service attack: they take longer to complete than to create. Therefore, I will always have to throw away ideas and plans.
  * Note-to-self is failing due to lack of review. Review is not happening because I haven't implemented tagging and searching.
  * Coming up with well-thought-out monthly questions does seem to aid seasonal review. Can paper really be a good medium for that?
  * I am reigning in my discretionary spending by creating another account from which all discretionary purchases will be made. I will begin filling it with the remainder of my cash from the pen show, and then make a regular allowance starting in the next month.
