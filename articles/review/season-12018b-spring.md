# Review Spring 12018

------------------------------------

I'm looking at my creative stuff as things I have to do rather than as things I'd rather do in preference to mindless consumption.
How do I tune the system so that it is no longer demotivating my creative work?
I'm happy for my adulting that I'm tracking my chores better, so that part of the system needs to be retained.

Separate out weekly focus and task lists.
That way I'm not thinking about my focus in the same way I think of tasks: as chores I "have" to do.
The same goes for my daily tasks, which I've now split into three columns: small, mid, fun.
Hopefully that will let me continue to have fun with them.

I'm considering carrying-in my focus from the last cycle when I don't immediately have anything that excites me.

Even 8 Apr 12018: getting up in the morning is a big thing that needs to be optimized

Midday 21 Apr 12018: possible depression, consider symptoms

------------------------------------

I'm amazed at how much my Mom & Seain[sp?] have read.
I wonder how I could do that better.
I think something that slows me down or turns me away from books is that whenever I'm consuming something, I'm thinking about how I could create something like that.
If so, that would explain whyI end up writing in styles that I've recently read, and why it's painful to read things that are so bad or wrong.

I had a thought, possibly in a dream, that reinterpreted the story of Sysyphus.
Instead of highlighting the caprice of the Greek gods, the polish of the boulder was indicative of a person's character.
As the boulder is pushed up & rolls back down, it becomes rounder and smoother.
Instead of representing life as a futile endeavor, it shows that the work of life is something to take pride and joy in.

Addy Pross' "What is Life" is an excellent book to takes notes on.
In the vein on real academic research, I should do that as soon as I've finished my first pass through the book.

If I'm going to be obsessed with D&D, should I be obsessed with building a system, or creating a story?

------------------------------------

I don't think seasonalism (different kinds of work in different seasons) is really doing anything for me at the moment.
I've got so much to experiment with and so much to develop that spring/summer are getting in each other's way.

There are times when I'm really quite glad to journal.

Binder clips on the midori have been really useful.

Skipping a week of gc isn't too bad, as long as I'm willing to spread out some of the process over two more gc cycles.

My special skill is semantics.
Recall that a semantics is an equivalence class over a language subject to the principle of compositionality.

Eve 10 May 12018: awareness&stillness coming together.

Duolingo apparently has some new features.
That notebook I got for my bday could be used as scratch paper for ukrainian writing practice.

------------------------------------

"Does this spark joy?" is a good question for intellectual organization as well.
If it doesn't, then it doesn't need follow-up, and can be archived/discarded.

Doing all my garbage collection in one day is reminiscent of stop-the-world garbage collection.
This weekend, I could have been doing interesting stuff, but was distracted by the pressure of garbage collection.
Perhaps I'll try out a more incremental version of gc, where I spend a little bit of each day doing a handful of gc tasks.

------------------------------------

Eve 22 May 12018: In a dream, I think I discovered a design tension within myself.
As an engineer, I like when the parts of a system have one of a few clearly defined functions and each part operates only to serve its given functions.
As an evolutionist, I know that a population's stability is dependent on its genetic diversity.
The tension comes when examining a living population as composed of parts.
I guess the tension is resolved when we recognize that engineered systems are simple: too simple to have high stability.
The question is, in what way to we complexify designed parts in order to allow for device population diversity and thereby achieve stability of technology?

Starting Night 22 May 12018, my journal is overrun by thoughts about digital design.
This has really increased my ability to complete my journal.
It's lucky, though, that those thoughts are easily discarded, since I'm in an early exploration/learning phase.

------------------------------------

I think I've decided that my hobby expenditures for the moment will be oriented to basic making tools and digital electronics.
I will return to miniatures and pens some time later.

I quite like the design approach advocated in The Art of Digital Design, in theory.
In reality, I think beginners should start by throwing hardware at the wall and seeing what sticks.
With CAD tools though, that can be much less expensive and time-consuming than using real hardware.

If it's important to kep in mind a focus, it's probably also important to keep in mind what _isn't_ in focus.
Therefore, I propose an "unfocus" for pointing out things that I've decided not to be thinking about, but am having a hard time not thinking about.
Such a list could be populated lazily through the timescale.
The unfocus could also be searched later to determine what my brain is really interested in.



It seems I have been engrossed in designing a homebrew computer.
Now that it is summer, I think that is a project I would like to stick with.
In particular, I should put langauge design on my summer unfocus.

It seems my systems last about six months before they start failing.
Perhaps I get around this by removing them all and rebuilding them.
Alternatively, I may be able to do an inventory of what seems most important, then jsut clean out the others.
So, what parts of my system are most important?
What missing aprts of my system are most important?

Speaking of important, I don't think the journal is so important anymore.
I may be saying that because I'm slipping on my entry rate, but actually: how important is it?
I think its purpose should be more for scribbles and brain crack extraction than establishing a routine.
