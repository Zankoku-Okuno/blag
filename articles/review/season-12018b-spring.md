# Review Spring 12018

------------------------------------

I'm looking at my creative stuff as things I have to do rather than as things I'd rather do in preference to mindless consumption.
How do I tune the system so that it is no longer demotivating my creative work?
I'm happy for my adulting that I'm tracking my chores better, so that part of the system needs to be retained.

Separate out weekly focus and task lists.
That way I'm not thinking about my focus in the same way I think of tasks: as chores I "have" to do.
The same goes for my daily tasks, which I've now split into three columns: small, mid, fun.
Hopefully that will let me continue to have fun with them.

I'm considering carrying-in my focus from the last cycle when I don't immediately have anything that excites me.

Even 8 Apr 12018: getting up in the morning is a big thing that needs to be optimized

Midday 21 Apr 12018: possible depression, consider symptoms
