# Review Spring 12018

------------------------------------

I'm looking at my creative stuff as things I have to do rather than as things I'd rather do in preference to mindless consumption.
How do I tune the system so that it is no longer demotivating my creative work?
I'm happy for my adulting that I'm tracking my chores better, so that part of the system needs to be retained.

Separate out weekly focus and task lists.
That way I'm not thinking about my focus in the same way I think of tasks: as chores I "have" to do.
The same goes for my daily tasks, which I've now split into three columns: small, mid, fun.
Hopefully that will let me continue to have fun with them.

I'm considering carrying-in my focus from the last cycle when I don't immediately have anything that excites me.

Even 8 Apr 12018: getting up in the morning is a big thing that needs to be optimized

Midday 21 Apr 12018: possible depression, consider symptoms

------------------------------------

I'm amazed at how much my Mom & Seain[sp?] have read.
I wonder how I could do that better.
I think something that slows me down or turns me away from books is that whenever I'm consuming something, I'm thinking about how I could create something like that.
If so, that would explain whyI end up writing in styles that I've recently read, and why it's painful to read things that are so bad or wrong.

I had a thought, possibly in a dream, that reinterpreted the story of Sysyphus.
Instead of highlighting the caprice of the Greek gods, the polish of the boulder was indicative of a person's character.
As the boulder is pushed up & rolls back down, it becomes rounder and smoother.
Instead of representing life as a futile endeavor, it shows that the work of life is something to take pride and joy in.

Addy Pross' "What is Life" is an excellent book to takes notes on.
In the vein on real academic research, I should do that as soon as I've finished my first pass through the book.

If I'm going to be obsessed with D&D, should I be obsessed with building a system, or creating a story?

------------------------------------

I don't think seasonalism (different kinds of work in different seasons) is really doing anything for me at the moment.
I've got so much to experiment with and so much to develop that spring/summer are getting in each other's way.

There are times when I'm really quite glad to journal.

Binder clips on the midori have been really useful.

Skipping a week of gc isn't too bad, as long as I'm willing to spread out some of the process over two more gc cycles.

My special skill is semantics.
Recall that a semantics is an equivalence class over a language subject to the principle of compositionality.

Eve 10 May 12018: awareness&stillness coming together.

Duolingo apparently has some new features.
That notebook I got for my bday could be used as scratch paper for ukrainian writing practice.
