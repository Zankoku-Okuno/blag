# Seasonal Review: Autumn 12018

## Longer Creative Cycles

As Hank Green says, "Nothing but time writes a book", and I think that's true of any ambitious creative project --- say a thousand-line mathematical formula^[program].


Grey remarks that pulling away from the internet means that he isn't changing nearly so much because he's not learning anything new about the world.
The question is: is it growth or noise that went with the feed?
One thing, though: disconnection + lack of novelty â†’ no good.

When your task list is infinite, the selection of what you work on is far more important than the fullness of time you spend on it.

Imagine drawing an photoraelistic tiger: it takes forever, and you can't imagine how the artist did it.
The thing to do is sit down and say "OK, all I have to do is draw this eye for the next hour," and just keep doing little bits well.
Similarly, when programming something like a compiler: "OK, all I'm doing for the next hour is perfecting this clause of the grammar for the next hour.
Further, an artist doesn't come back to an old work and start again from scratch: they start from where they left off.
When I sit down to resume a task, I need to not jsut throw away what came before just because I don't understand what I wrote before.
Part of that is leaving projects with better documentation, but perhaps most of that is not giving up so soon on trying to understand the old code.


## Sewing

In October, I got my mmom to coach me through some sewing.
Apparently, I have a knack; given how straight my seams look, I'd agree.
The thing I'll have to work on is understanding the strength of designs and what geometries are most important to get right.

I may well be able, with practice, to be able to build a bag system for myself.
