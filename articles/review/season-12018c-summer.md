# Review Summer 12018

Long story short, my action-analysis loop is broken, but I've realized how important it is.
Almost half of this review is just me thinking about how I build an evolution-first system.


## For Next Time

This time, I'm putting follow-up at the top.
It's the last thing I write, but it's the first thing I should read when I look back at a review.

  * Am I asking myself what I'd do with my morning when I wake up?
    Do I need to have an alarm that asks me?
  * Did I think about getting focuses into a resumable rather than a completed state?
  * Did the new follow-up system help improve my systems faster?
  * Do I have a better grasp on scheduled items?
    How about making schedules of my own?
  * Did I ask "Does it spark joy?"
  * Is my shortlist/longlist better managed now?
  * How did black calendar entries go?
  * Regarding changing Sisyphus, did I move fast and break things?
  * Have I got any good ideas on how to manage principles?





## Big Questions

It seems like I'm starting to get a hold on some of the big questions.
It's something that I've been missing previously, and if I'm finally starting to think about these right, I'll have a better idea of what I'm actually aiming for when I design my systems or otherwise make decisions.

I've previously thought about my goal in life as contributing to the advance of world civilization.
That perspective has haunted me, though: I've tied my identity to it, even though it's intractable to know what effects you have on your future light cone, and so I've been continuously doubtful about myself.
The problem was really brought into stark contrast when Hank Green mentioned that thinking about success as "being in the top tier of usefulness to society" is a messed up way of looking at it; after all, by definition only a few people can be top-tier, so that mindset sets up the vast majority of people for disappointment at their own life.

**The goal is to build a life that is more than just maintenance.**
This purpose avoids the intractability problems that "higher purposes" can induce, and thereby I hope will avoid so much self-judgment.
I can go into more depth or quantify this later, but this is a flexible starting point.


I've also found out how to identify fundamental principles.
If a proposed principle requires its user to make trade-offs, then it is not a principle, but a consequence of something deeper.
A lot of the things I've labeled "principles" are not principles in this sense.


If I were to answer "What is Sisyphus for?", I'd have to say that **I am trying to figure out how to live a life instead of survive my life.**
At this point, I've only just begun designing Sisyphus; like any large creation, the design could take the rest of my life.
At only one year into a hopefully 50+ year project, I can't expect to be stumbling across or especially predicting what system will actually work well.
At this point, I should be treating the problem as still deep in the explore phase, and nowhere near exploit.
I therefore need to temper my expectations, since the stuff I do find will either be basic, or wrong.





## Sisyphus

Sisyphus needs an update.
I've been putting it off for a long time, but there are a lot of little things that the system isn't particularly good at.
There's going to be a huge trick to it, though.
**Improving Sisyphus right now is a matter of simplifying, not extending.**
Unfortunately, a lot of the fall-down seems to be that too many slightly different things are grouped together.

It's time to sit down and figure out what kinds of things I need my system to handle.
I'll be thinking about and experimenting with these this fall.
  * review/follow-up
  * shortlist/focus, longlist
  * scheduling
  * reminders
  * checklist (design and usage)
  * note collection
  * note searching
  * principles collection (attitudinal and design)


Given that I'm in an exploratory phase, I should move fast and break things.
Nothing is more flexible and re-configurable than a piece of paper.
Software, on the other hand, requires work to configure, and then it's hard to re-configure or move to another app.
However, software has an advantage in that it can actively remind you; paper can only serve as a reminder if your eyes move to the right spot.
If I do need some software, if programming would take more than a day (that is, one _expected_ day), then I should just try an app.
Only later, when I have a decent idea of how things work in practice should I put more than a couple days into a meta-project.


### Review

Being in an exploratory phase, follow-up is going to be important, but I've realized I don't have anything really to organize my reviews.
Obviously, I have my seasonal review blag, but that's a very long timescale for some things.
The thing is, my blag'd reviews take too much work to do quickly, since they are being published.

Efficient evolution needs a Sisyphus that is **review-heavy, but with light reviews.**

I think the single most important thing about getting a review done is to have all my notes in one place.
In fact, I'm not sure that I really need much more in a review than organized notes.
I'm definitely thinking about having a dedicated notebook for follow-up, but I feel like I need at least some slight structure, rather than simply tossing notes into a blank notebook as they come to me.

I can't expect constant growth in my reviews.
What should I be expecting in them?
Military-style debriefing surely has something to say about it, but I think I might need to learn this from a mentor rather than a book.
I've thought that asking questions is good, but I always seem to ask too many and the wrong ones.


### Focus

I shifted back to a physical monthly focus, but I can't say that it particularly helped.
That might have something to do with depression, but that's probably not all.
The paper hid itself from me quite quickly, and I ended up not doing many of the things on it.
Granted, focus is about suggestions, but if my focus is so immediately out-of-date, what's the point?

Let's say (because it is at the moment) that my theme is longer cycles of action.
It seems like the role a monthly focus plays should be to expand on that theme.
Perhaps it's more about the artifacts that would be signs of progress on the theme?
I think the focus definitely needs to stay more flexible than it has been.
Perhaps a focus will develop naturally out of a faster, smoother review cycle time.


One thing the focus does is pick out projects from my shortlist.
"As shortlists go, it's looking more like a longlist."
I really could use a physical shortlist that I can garbage collect.
Rolodex?, with projects on cards and dividers to segregate different activeness levels?

Something the focus happened to pick up was attitudinal principles.
It occurs to me that I'm not remembering design principles long-term.
Is there a way I can make them more salient so I can keep them in mind more easily when I think about things?
Perhaps I can leave them in the focus for now, or at least with a similar structure, and allow the physicality improvements to pull principles along with the projects.


### Checklist

Checklists need to work at arm's length.

My reminders app seems to have expanded to the point that stuff is mixed up and I have to take care.
I wish I could have checklists for each item, but that's not going to make it into the app.

My paper checklists are getting hidden.
They were at the end of my front Midori book, which is ostensibly easy-to-find, but is an unnatural place for book navigation.
The only one that I actually used was my garbage collection checklist, but that's because I got reminders to use it.

Even though I used it, my checklist experiment --- rebuilding my gc checklist to use dates --- was not as successful as hoped.
The part where I choose a set of gc tasks and spend an hour a weekenday has done wonders for my mental state.
On the other hand, I have little idea about what's most important, and comparing the dates is difficult.
For this, I think I need a computer system to order things appropriately.

Something I've noticed is that my gc checklist contains two kinds of items.
One type is actual collection of thoughts into more appropriate locations.
The other consists of simple regular maintenance tasks more similar to cleaning or hygiene than thinking.
These need to be separated in order for the cleaning reminders to be effective.


### Scheduling

I don't control things by time very well.
What controls do I do well, or should I just add automation and notifications?

I think I don't like to plan ahead.
Or perhaps, it's that I have no good tools.
Simple calendars aren't capable of managing my large projects, and even sophisticated project management will likely have a hard time with my usual creative or exploratory process since it won't fit into a schedule well.

I think the first problem to solve is that of hard deadlines/appointments.
I need to see these things more than one day out so that I'm not surprised by them, and can communicate my constraints to others better.
That handles urgent stuff, but not important stuff.
In particular, I'm worried that I might unbalance creative and non-creative energy again.
If I track important stuff as if they were urgent, then I'd probably be okay intuitively balancing the two.
Unfortunately, I'm quite bad at meeting simple deadlines I give myself, so I need to try some other options.
  * Ask someone else to ask me how stuff is going?
  * Use a timer and active questions?
  * Hang deadlines off external events (e.g. Lexember)?
  * Time tracker to look at my time disbursement?

When I get to planning creativity, then I can worry about more complex stuff.
The following list is really just a bunch of speculation that I want to not necessarily forget when I go to brainstorm.

  * floating times (within a timeframe, but not specifically set)
  * work-time estimates backed by time tracking data (both time spent on specific work, and the time that I spend each day on work)
  * normal and skew distributions would be great models
  * map out my schedule for a timeframe and see how creative work fits in


### Miscellany

Something I've noticed about my Bullet Journal process --- as opposed to the recommended --- is that I'm not doing an end-of-day review.
I've just added a notification to fix that, and will need to follow-up on it.
This is probably a good time to try my proposed follow-up system.

I set up an hourly stretch reminder on my computer.
Actually, I quickly tuned it to a twenty-minute timer just so I have a chance of catching it sometimes.
It seems to actually be working for now, but I need to edit the message to be more general:
I'm stretching more, but I need to stand up regularly and get my spinal fluid flowing.

Can websites send notifications on my phone?

An automatic schedule planner is unnecessary if I have a button that marks as complete and also prompts for rescheduling.





## Technical

Since I don't move stuff out of my airbook, I've lost my experimental platform.

I still have a bunch of new computer fixups/followups on pp. 46-49.

I need to learn how diffing algorithms if I ever want to diff APIs.
I should probably learn it for lists first, then trees, and then specialize/extend the tree algo to APIs.

When I read someone like Barendregt, I should remember that
  * I'll learn everything I ever wanted to know, but
  * there will also be a lot of stuff that I don't want to know (yet)





## Quips

Nothing lasts forever --- except trouble: there's always trouble.

"Whether we write in rock or sand..."

As much time as I _need_ to learn; as much time as I _can_ to practice.

Don't do cleanup (esp. of code) w/o a checklist, or else cleanup creep becomes likely.
My incremental gc actually follows this principle.
As a corollary, when doing some cleanup, write down the pattern of cleanup you're doing in the coding standards document.
For picking gc tasks, this has worked out well.





## Career

I've been thinking a lot about my career lately and where I might go with it.
  * can I get my loans forgiven in a couple years of teaching? Is that the fastest way for me to make money?
  * program something that requires more quality?
  * PhD goals?

In the next 8-10 months, (at this rate) I'll have a yearfull of savings.
There will then be no excuse for delaying going for a PhD or another job.





## Stuff about Myself

When stuff is digitized, it hides from me.

If I come up with a plan for something creative ,that can suck the creativity out of it; at the same time, I do need plans sometimes.

I don't do well at munching through a linear list of tasks.
Instead, try to have a variety of tasks that could be approached independently: parallel resumable progression.

Ideas are safe because they are never bad.
I have "great" phonologies because the phonology is the idea --- never bad --- but the words are the execution, and I often fall down there.

If creativity is part of my identity, but I don't feel like I'm doing enough or well enough...

I'm invent-and-forget, like software.

It's important to take a break --- even from hobbies.
That said, I know I'm unlikely to revisit a hobby if I don't schedule the break explicitly and set reminders.





## Follow Up

I've successfully trained my brain to think that my focus is not a list of tasks to be checked off.
Somehow, this happened even though I kept putting checkmarks down for them.
Maybe I'll try again to use a different mark, or maybe it really doesn't matter.

The unfocus seems not to have worked very well anyway.
That shouldn't be surpriseing: if I'm falling into actions, then I wouldn't have checked a list first.
I'm going to stop trying that.
Instead, I'll mark accidental actions in black on my calendar to show my brain what it's doing.

I've seen some use of "Does it spark joy?", but it's been spotty.
That said, it has come in handly to bypass work I didn't really want to do.
I guess it's time to double-down on it.

I think waking up has been most optimized by setting my alarm more evenly between weekdays and weekendays.
I have had the presence of mind to ask what I would do if I woke up earlier, so that seems to be a strategy in need of reinforcement.

As far as Sisyphus improvements are concerned, I didn't think about it as much as I expected.
That said, I think I have much better ideas of where to go with it now than I did a season ago.
As I write this review, I am throwing more systems at the wall and seeing what sticks.

I definitely have kept using my journal.
I haven't collected any data from it since I had to move to a new notebook, but that doesn't seem to impact my use of it.
In fact, it seems I've gone far enough with the practice already that I've simply found a relaxing thing.

I think `okuno.info` has served its purpose.
It got me through a time where I was constantly asking myself "Now what?", and I'm no longer dealing with that problem.
There are good ideas in there, but the collection of features currently there is not what I need right now.
