# Review Summer 12018

## Big Questions

It seems like I'm starting to get a hold on some of the big questions.

The goal is to build a life that is more than just maintenance.

The general starting point when people define success is whether they are in the top tier of being useful to society, but that's a messed up way of looking at it.
After all, it's top-tier precisely because few people can be in it.

If I were to answer "What is Sisyphus for?", I'd have to say that I am trying to figure out how to live a life instead of survive my life.
Obviously, I've only just started, so I should expect to be mostly exploring, finding basic stuff, and getting lots of stuff wrong; I'm certainly not going to be designing or stumbling into the perfect system already.


## Sisyphus

I should be quicker to implement systems to enable me to hit clear goals (such as stop browsing youtube; get up from the computer every hour).
I.e. try a thing and see if it works rather than trying to predict myself and build something I think will be really good only to have it fail.

Improving Sisyphus right now is a matter of simplifying, not extending.

I can't expect constant growth in my reviews. What should I be expecting in them?

Checklists need to work at arm's length.

At least I have my review notes all in one place.
That's apparently a huge thing for getting reviews actually done.

Perhaps monthly focus should be more about artifacts.
Perhaps also scheduling info can be transported along through focus.

I feel like I'm not really remembering principles.
Is there a way I can make them physically big so I can keep them in mind more easily when I think about things?

GC differs from regular maintenance activities differs from items for follow-up.

### Review

Review-heavy, but light reviews.

Consider: a physical journal dedicated to follow-up and review.

I need to learn how to do debriefing.
I at least need a system to remind me to do follow-up.
`okuno.info` might already be pretty good for that, as long as I can remember to check it.
Then again, perhaps a normal calendar is simpler?

### Maintenance Tasks

I need a way to get myself to look at "older" stuff in bujo.
That is, stuff I didn't do the day before, general plans for the week, focus, and okuno.info.

I've got a lot of stuff in my gc checklist that should actually be regular things: the prime example is backups.

Don't do cleanup (esp. of code) w/o a checklist, or else cleanup creep becomes likely.
My incremental gc actually follows this principle.
As a corollary, when doing some cleanup, write down the pattern of cleanup you're doing in the coding standards document.
- This has worked out well, as far as picking gc tasks

Lot's of Sisyphus in Cortex #72.
I need to set an hourly stretch reminder to activate while I'm on the computer. (How did that go?)
Can websites send notifications on my phone?
An automatic schedule planner is unnecessary if I have a button that marks as complete and also prompts for rescheduling.
Put youtube on gc.

"As shortlists go, it's looking more like a longlist."
I really could use a physical shortlist that I can garbage collect.
Rolodex?, with projects on cards and dividers to segregate different activeness levels?

## Scheduling

I don't control things by time very well. What controls do I do well, or should I just add automation?

I think I don't like to plan ahead.
Or perhaps, it's that I have no good tools.
Simple calendars have a big problem with large projects, and even sophisticated project management will likely have a hard time with my usual creative or exploratory projects since they don't fit into a schedule well.

Flexible Prediction:
  * I need to see things further than one day out.
  * Estimates backed by time-tracking data.
  * Normal or skew distributions would be great models, but what would such a distribution mean? Strength to rise to the top of the list?

Make important stuff urgent by imposing deadlines.
Unfortunately, I'm quite bad at meeting simple deadlines I give myself.
  * Ask someone else to ask me how stuff is going?
  * Use a timer and active questions?
  * Hang deadlines off external events (e.g. Lexember)?


## Technical

Since I don't move stuff out of my airbook, I've lost my experimental platform.

I still have a bunch of new computer fixups/followups on pp. 46-49.

I need to learn how diffing algorithms if I ever want to diff APIs.
I should probably learn it for lists first, then trees, and then specialize/extend the tree algo to APIs.

When I read someone like Barendregt, I should remember that
  * I'll learn everything I ever wanted to know, but
  * there will also be a lot of stuff that I don't want to know (yet)


## Quips

Nothing lasts forever --- except trouble: there's always trouble.

As much time as I _need_ to learn; as much time as I _can_ to practice.

Your brain doesn't stay plastic without a little melting from time to time.

"Whether we write in rock or sand..."


## Career

I've been thinking a lot about my career lately and where I might go with it.
  * can I get my loans forgiven in a couple years of teaching? Is that the fastest way for me to make money?
  * program something that requires more quality?
  * PhD goals?

In the next 8-10 months, (at this rate) I'll have a yearfull of savings.
There will then be no excuse for delaying going for a PhD or another job.


## Stuff about myself

When stuff is digitized, it hides from me.

If I come up with a plan for something creative ,that can suck the creativity out of it; at the same time, I do need plans sometimes.

I don't do well at munching through a linear list of tasks. Instead, try to have a variety of tasks that could be approached independently: parallel resumable progression.

Ideas are safe because they are never bad.
I have "great" phonologies because the phonology is the idea --- never bad --- but the words are the execution, and I often fall down there.

If creativity is part of my identity, but I don't feel like I'm doing enough or well enough...

I'm invent-and-forget, like software.

It's important to take a break --- even from hobbies.
That said, I know I'm unlikely to revisit a hobby if I don't schedule the break explicitly and set reminders.



## Media

About the moon landing: "It wasn't a miricle, we just decided to go." How do I get that astronaut can-do attitude? There's a book "Failure is not an Option" I may want to read.

"Inadequate Equilibria" might actually be a decent book.

"Aspect" by Bernard Comrie
