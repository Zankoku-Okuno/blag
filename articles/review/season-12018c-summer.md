# Review Summer 12018

I can't expect constant growth in my reviews. What should I be expecting in them?

Don't do cleanup (esp. of code) w/o a checklist, or else cleanup creep becomes likely.
My incremental gc actually follows this principle.
As a corollary, when doing some cleanup, write down the pattern of cleanup you're doing in the coding standards document.


Stuff about myself:
  * When stuff is digitized, it hides from me.
  * If I come up with a plan for something creative ,that can suck the creativity out of it; at the same time, I do need plans sometimes.
  * I don't do well at munching through a linear list of tasks. Instead, try to have a variety of tasks that could be approached independently: parallel resumable progression.
  * I'm invent-and-forget, like software.

Nothing lasts forever --- except trouble: there's always trouble.

Since I don't move stuff out of my airbook, I've lost my experimental platform.

Lot's of Sisyphus in Cortex #72.
I need to set an hourly stretch reminder to activate while I'm on the computer.
Can websites send notifications on my phone?
An automatic schedule planner is unnecessary if I have a button that marks as complete and also prompts for rescheduling.
Put youtube on gc.

I don't control things by time very well. What controls do I do well, or should I just add automation?

I still have a bunch of new computer fixups/followups on pp. 46-49.

I should be quicker to implement systems to enable me to hit clear goals (such as stop browsing youtube; get up from the computer every hour).

I need to learn how to do debriefing.
I at least need a system to remind me to do follow-up.
`okuno.info` might already be pretty good for that, as long as I can remember to check it.
Then again, perhaps a normal calendar is simpler?

I need to learn how diffing algorithms if I ever want to diff APIs.
I should probably learn it for lists first, then trees, and then specialize/extend the tree algo to APIs.

In the next 8-10 months, (at this rate) I'll have a yearfull of savings.
There will then be no excuse for delaying going for a PhD or another job.

As much time as I _need_ to learn; as much time as I _can_ to practice.
