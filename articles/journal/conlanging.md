# Systems for Conlanging

It's not a joke that after coming on the Conlangery Podcast, I have had zero success at conlanging.
Part of that is that I had other things to do---get a job, finish my masters degree, other hobbies---but another part is that I have become acutely aware of the inadequacies of my organizational system for conlangs.
Now that I am always carrying a notebook with me, I am able to record conlang ideas at any time, which has helped, but without an organizational system, I'm worried that my efforts will collapse again.

## The Prior, Unconscious Design

There was a mush of text documents, a couple word documents for reference, an excel file for the lexicon, and, if I had gotten that far, some example texts spread across a few more random word documents.
All of these were potentially desynch'd in complex ways: when comparing one document to another, some parts might be ahead while others behind.


## Forcing Decisions

That (lack of) system creates a Schr√∂dinger's file folder of half-decisions, and from that only comes frustration, not a language.
I therefore need to step up my ability to make a solid decision and remember it.
I'll also need some way to track those decisions to that I can relate new decisions to what has come before.

I can only be happy making a conlanging decision when I'm happy a choice will work well, and I can only have that when I can test my language in real sentences.
Creating real sentences means already having a lot of decisions, but without testing, some of those decisions will inevitably be poor.
Thankfully, when tests fail, they fail in instructive ways.
If I can't effectively use those lessons to change the (already fairly large) conlang, the language is doomed to fail.


## The Synching Problem

As I have learned from my job, the correct way to manage a large, complex body of work is to record the bare facts, then show all work leading to conclusions.
In the case of conlanging, the bare facts are (a) innumerable decisions about the phonetic, grammatical, and lexical tendencies of the language, and (b) the exceptions.
The conclusions are texts and utterances.
Intermediate (but artistically very interesting) conclusions are the phonology, the lexicon, and the grammar.

Recording exceptions is interesting, but likely to be an under-thought-out part of any system.
Where many aspects of a language can be determined from regular patterns, exceptions can occur at any point above the basic decisions.
That is, it must be possible for any expected conclusion to be overridden by an exception.
There are more (intermediate) conclusions than you think there are.

The broadest strokes of tracking changes is to simply record the date of creation/change for each decision and conclusion, then check & update all derived work whenever the bare facts change.
As a language grows, this becomes infeasible.
If we can also ease the burden of performing updates (i.e. re-conjugating all words in sample texts based on a change to the inflectional morphology), that would be a massive help.
Initially, that might only be an enhancement instead of a necessity, but as the body of derived work grows, it may become a necessity.
