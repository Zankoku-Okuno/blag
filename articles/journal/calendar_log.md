# Calendrical Logging

In 12017, I kept a record of "important" things that I did each day, but since there were no further rules, I wasn't very consistent.
I also ended up not using the data for review or reflection.
This year, I'd like to track a few different things, not necessarily with the same drive as last year ended up having, and I'd like to complete the action-analysis loop.


The principles are
  * **Agentive:** I'll only log it if I take an active part and I consciously made the decision to do it.
    I'm no longer counting video games unless I weighed other options first.
    However, I may well count watching video if I actually decided to.
  * **Spheres of Action:** I'll log whether the action is biological, economic, social, memetic, meta, or downtime.
    I was inconsistent last year about whether "chores to stay alive" counted.
  * **Direction:** I'll log whether an action was self-improvement or world-improvement.
  * **Level of Detail:** I'll write specifics about non-regular actions, but not regular ones.
    So, budgeting will simply be a note that I did something economical for myself, but reading a book will be the name of the book.

The mechanics are:
  * Each sphere gets its own color.
  * When direction applies to an action, it will be a left arrow for recieving and a right arrow for giving. When both happened, it's a two-way arrow, and when the concept doesn't apply, it's a simple dot.

To complete the action-analysis loop:
  * I will write a small review as a regular part of garbage collection.
    It may be more effective to keep a running weekly review and use the last Friday of the month to perform an edit.
  * In the review I will make reference to the previous review(s) to help maintain continuity.


## Notes

Here are some interesting decisions that I've had to make so I can keep a log of precedent.
I'm not going to hold myself to precedent all that closely, but it's good to have a record when the next review happens.
