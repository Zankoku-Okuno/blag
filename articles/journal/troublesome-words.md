# Troublesome Words

Sometimes an idea is represented with a word that becomes trendy.
Once the word is trendy, you can bet that it will be misused.
Since the meaning of a word is determined by its use, the idea disappears as the word changes allegiances.
Eventually, it cannot even be determined if the original idea was good or not.
As such, I think that good ideas deserve definitions and explanations that are grounded in practicality.

## Mindfulness

The original meaning of [sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(Buddhism)) was already unclear when it was translated to English "mindfulness".
Since then, it has become (in some people's minds) something that is a compartmentalized activity like an exercise routine.
I've found myself using it in a different way---that the utility of mindfulness becomes apparent when you can be mindful in everyday life.
Nevertheless, what exactly is this "mindful" word trying to get at?

There is a particular attribute I am looking to cultivate in myself: making decisions as a sentience rather than being thrown about by instinctual fears and craving.
I think this can further be broken down into three virtues:
  * **awareness** with which to recognize the actions you are taking
  * **conscientiousness** with which to discriminate good decisions from poor ones
  * **stillness** with which to act without fear or hesitation

I don't think I've captured "sati" in any of these words, but there is something related.
In particular, sati involves an awareness of relative value, whereas my "awareness" involves simply being attentive to the thoughts of your mind and the world in which you find yourself.
Even my awareness+conscientiousness doesn't seem to cover it.

Stillness, of the three, was the most difficult to find a word for.
It may have something to do with [mushin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_(mental_state)) (no-mind).

In any case, I'm not really trying to match the meaning of pre-existing words.
I'm trying to enunciate, so that it may be better understood, a technique that tends towards minimizing regret.
I think we regret things that we didn't have a choice in, that we knew were bad decisions and chose to do anyway, and that we procrastinate on out of fear.
Those three ideas together form a complete picture of a worthy act.
Of course, building mastery in them will require other ideas as well.

## Growth Mindset

I think I've been laboring under the impression that this is a trendy term.
It's more like technical jargon, maybe.
In any case, it has all the attributes of a trendy-ificatable word: sounds like a panacea, but is far easier said than done.

It's true that thinking of yourself as having the growth mindset is helpful for learning, it is not sufficient.
Really, it's that fixed mindset is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The word I like better is self-cultivation.
Well, I don't see any reason to focus on the "self-" in self-cultivation, so let's go with "cultivation".
As anyone who has tried to keep a garden before knows, cultivation is a long and difficult process that pays off slowly.
I don't have much more than that, unfortunately.

## Entrepreneur

Entrepreneur is a word that has some good attributes; it describes a person who takes an active part in their life and tries to make an impact on the world.
On the other hand, it being a capitalist word, it suggests that an entrepreneur is concerned primarily with the accumulation of material wealth.
What about people who are actively trying to make a difference, but don't care much for their wallet?
What about people who ultimately just want to heal, or to teach, or to create art, or to build tools, or all the rest?
The people in the open source community---people who give away their time with no expectation of return---cannot be called entrepreneurs, so what are they?
What am I?

I would just steal voker from Too Like the Lightning, but it's really only applicable to a post-scarcity economy if it's going to mean what it means in the books.
I thought about idea of being a "pro", not in the sense of being paid to do something, but in the sense of _The War of Art_.
Unfortunately, that sentiment---"The professional knows that the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work sets in motion a mysterious process that produces inspiration."---is not what I mean.
I even thought about "ownliver" as in Newspeak's "ownlife", but that's more related to freedom of thought than what I have in mind.
I almost thought "leader" almost worked despite its buzzwordiness, but successful leading requires followers, and that's not an implication I want to promote.
"Malcontent" is likewise close, but implies maliciousness.

What is the word the willingness to act in spite of the inertia of comfort?
