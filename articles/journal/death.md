# On Death

We like to think that the death of humans is always bad.
This, I think, derives from the idea that individual organisms are the apex of dynamically stable entities.
If, however, humans (and other organisms) are not the ultimate carrier of personal identity, then we have to consider the possibility that human death is subservient to the needs of larger identies (e.g. societies or civilizations).
