There already exists some keyboard firmware out there, such as [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), though I'm not sure I'll use it.

[Some Arduino APIs for keyboards](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/).
Here's what answered the question of how to [read keyboard LED status](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=166638.0).
This is some possible information on implementing [media keys](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/8934/send-keyboard-media-keys-with-keyboard-library).
The Teensy site has some info on [Using the USB Keyboard API](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_keyboard.html) and a [Keypad Library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Keypad.html).
Here a [USB HID usage table](http://www.freebsddiary.org/APC/usb_hid_usages.php)

Here's some information about modding a WASD:

Here's someone who made a wireless mechanical keyboard out of a WASD: [BLE WASD](https://hackaday.io/project/7646-ble-wasdmechanical-wireless-keyboard).
