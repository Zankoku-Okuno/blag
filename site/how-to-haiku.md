# How to Haiku

I enjoy writing Japanese-langauge haiku (as well as my poor grasp of Japanese grammer allows), but I have not yet collected all of my reserach into one place.

[This blog post](https://thehaikuexperiment.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/the-spaces-of-robert-hass/) made mention of a book by Toshiharu Oseko that looks very interesting.

Here's some links about Classical Japanese:

We don't get snow except every few years where I live, so when it does snow, no one wants to be on the road.
I was walking home from the train station during a snowstorm and noticed a strange pattern on the ground.
Looking more carefully, I saw it was the shadows of the snowflakes cast by a streetlamp overhead.
Between the fluttering of the snow and the topography of the already-fallen snow, the shadows moved around excitedly.
Later, I noticed that I could actually see the snow itself, since it was white-on-white, but I could tell exactly when any given flaske hit the ground --- its shadow would suddenly disappear.
