# January 12018

I need a place to put my life goals:
  * writing
  * music
  * conlanging
  * teaching
  * research
  * painting/fine art

It seems I'm making a bin for blag-about-later stuff that can be detached from garbage colelction.

I nearly missed what I was planning to do in Feb, but I spotted it at the end of the Jan review.
