## Meta Minimization

I am doing too much meta.
Though I like to focus on questions, answers this obvious deserve to be written down.
I'm still happy with the monthly focus, but meta work should not operate at the same frequency.
That is, I'd rather optimize for primarily living my life, and spend less time looking back on it.
It's not that I'm giving up on method over outcome, but I am currently spending more than half of my weekend in meta, leaving little time to even use my methods in the first place.

## Slipping off Focus

I was much less able to stick to my focus this month.
There are two forces behind that.
First, I wrote the focus before inspiration struck, which meant I attempted to force it: my alleged passion this month felt like a chore.
Second, once I found my inspiration, a number of social events came up, so I only got about a day to work on my new focus.

I will be changing my approach to my monthly focus.
I will treat it as a flexible entity where large projects may be added or removed as necessary to motivate me.
Smaller projects will continue to be more of a to-do list.
Essentially, it will be less of a discipline set out ahead of time, and more of a gentle reminder of what I am up to.

Even with only a small experience of [Bullet Journalling](http://bulletjournal.com/), it was clear how it enhanced my understanding of timed obligations.
These were the primary frustrators of my focus towards the end of this month.
So, I will continue to be fastidious about scheduling with my journal, and hopefully the social interruption problem will simply dissipate; I may still get a big batch of social stuff, but I have no problem with being social, I'd just like to see it not be frustrating.

## Large Projects

Something that has been catching my mind is the thought of projects that could consume my life.
I began the month noting that I don't have a good place to put these goals, but near the end, I made just such a list in my free writing.
I've transcribed that list here for future reference, but this is still an open problem.
In particular, these projects require lots of organization: e.g. I may need to plan to move abroad.
A robust, mature system will be necessary for that.
It will be valuable to get experience managing one month or a year at a time before I try to manage a decade at a time.
My hope is that I will be able to grow `okuno.info` into just such a system; we shall see later in the year if this strategy is encouraging.

As promised, here is a list of my largest goals:
  * **Teach**
  * Research
  * Art something
      * conlanging
      * music
      * writing
      * making
      * painting
  * Learn a language to fluency

## Questions

  * **Mindmapping: what is it useful for?**
    This month I downloaded and began to use [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) to organize my thoughts about redo.
    It definitely appears to be useful, but I'm not sure why.
    What is the form of problem that mindmapping addresses?
    I expect only additional use of the technique will provide an answer.
  * **What parts of my meta are inessential?**
    The answer to last months question "If the system falls down when I am sick, is that an indication that it should be made easier?" is _yes_.
    Even when I am not sick, review and garbage collection are taking up too much of my time.
    I already have ideas to (1) leave review notes in the notebooks rather than transfer them to the computer, (2) make better use of pointers to interesting things rather than develop them immediately, (3) consider an additional nursery stage during garbage collection, and (4) create a big, searchable and tagged bucket of ideas, like a twitter that only my future self subscribes to.
  * **How to I better access hidden information?**
    I did not look at my Janurary review this month until just now.
    My review system is currently hidden, which may be a significant hinderance.

### Notes

Slacktime should be ~20%, because ~80% utilization is optimal.
Any more utilization than that, and unexpected loads will cause disproportionate system slowdowns.

[Inspiration Boards](http://owl-ink.com/owl-ink-inspiration-boards/) are the amazing design tools I never knew I needed.
