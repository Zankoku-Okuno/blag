# February 12018

I need a place to put my life goals:
  * writing
  * music
  * conlanging
  * teaching
  * research
  * painting/fine art

It seems I'm making a bin for blag-about-later stuff that can be detached from garbage collection.

I nearly missed what I was planning to do in Feb, but I spotted it at the end of the Jan review.

[Inspiration Boards](http://owl-ink.com/owl-ink-inspiration-boards/) as a design tool.

I'd like at some point to dig into Japanese aesthetics more.
At the moment, I have only a couple of journal entries and a few starting points:
  * Morn & Eve 28 Jan 12018
  * [Wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)
  * [Some Japanese aesthetic principles](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/09/exposing-ourselves-to-traditional-japanese-aesthetic-ideas-notions-that-may-seem-quite-foreign-to-most-of-us-is-a-goo.html)
  * [Mushin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_(mental_state))

It seems like I have much less garbage collection to do this weekend.
Part of that is me just falling asleep (metaphorically & literally), part is my general frustration with Gradle this week, but part is probably that my idea train has slowed its roll.

Even though I built my plan for the month, I'm not making much progress on it.
I think it could simply be that I approached it from a slightly wrong angle.
Skipping into Gradle immediately before nailing down my development environment rubric and especially without committing to a project significantly increased the frustration in my attempt to learn it.

This week I realized that I've been implementing djb's redo completely wrong.
I further noticed that I should have been doing test-driven development the whole time; prior attempts had the tests tacked on after-the-fact, but this ended up not testing much, and I always felt like I was ignoring innumerable small but important decisions.

Of course, I'm slipping more and more off my month focus on development environments.
It could just be that I picked the wrong big project for the month.
Janurary, I came up with my major focus after latching onto a good idea; it could be better if I left space on my monthly focus for when I do latch onto a good idea.

On a completely different note, my doodle game is _on point_!
