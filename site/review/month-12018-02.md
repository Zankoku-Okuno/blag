# February 12018

I need a place to put my life goals:
  * writing
  * music
  * conlanging
  * teaching
  * research
  * painting/fine art

It seems I'm making a bin for blag-about-later stuff that can be detached from garbage colelction.

I nearly missed what I was planning to do in Feb, but I spotted it at the end of the Jan review.

[Inspiration Boards](http://owl-ink.com/owl-ink-inspiration-boards/) as a design tool.

I'd like at some point to dig into Japanese aesthetics more.
At the moment, I have only a couple of journal entries and a few starting points:
  * Morn & Eve 28 Jan 12018
  * [Wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi)
  * [Some Japanese aesthetic principles](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/09/exposing-ourselves-to-traditional-japanese-aesthetic-ideas-notions-that-may-seem-quite-foreign-to-most-of-us-is-a-goo.html)
  * [Mushin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_(mental_state))
