# January 12018

## Slacktime

This month started with low motivation, possibly as a result of the abnormal holiday schedule.
Then, after a small comeback, I had another week of disruption: bed assembly, sickness, and wedding.
I am reminded of the time last year when I got food poisoning and the system fell down for six weeks.

This time around, I was much more successful.
As a result of being slack earlier in the week, I asked myself how I could recover more quickly after disruptions of routine.
I think that question put me in the right mindset to resume work as soon as I could.

I think the outcome in this case may have been more of a fluke, unfortunately.
I was needed for the wedding, so I stepped up to that.
I'm curious if --- and doubt that --- I can pull off the same recovery under my own motivation.
I was reminded of the talk [Accessibility for UX: Don't worry, it's much worse than you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAZhi3W6LOs), wherein it was pointed out that whatever makes a site easier for the mentally handicapped also makes it easier for the abled.
Perhaps I can use that philosophy to optimize my system to work better for when I am less able, and also to consume less overhead time.


## Academics

The monthly focus system seems to be working well to keep me on task.
After I found my research question, I've done no programming or academic writing on other subjects.
As a result, I have good notes on exactly the question I am answering, a solid mathematical basis, and good notes on what needs explanation.
Further, I think I have a good idea of what I am going to do next month.

Writing this review, I've noticed that there's no place for scheduling ideas more than one month away.
There's [okuno.info](okuno.info) of course, but that seems not to be a great way to manage open-ended tasks or focuses, not at the moment anyway.

I've begun reading research in a new way as well.
All it is is taking notes alongside the reading, but it has been highly effective for near-term writing.
I'll be curious how well my notes stack up when I return to older notes.
I may develop the notetaking further; here's one possible workflow:
The first pass through a paper is just to give me a feel for the overall idea and what's interesting about it.
Before the second pass, I write down my impressions.
This part is akin to John Bartholomew's advice on analyzing your own chess: try to identify key points in the game before moving to computer analysis.
The second pass is then an opportunity to read more closely and take specific notes about key ideas and the questions I am left with.
During the second pass, a closer look at the mathematics is a good idea, but a deep dive can wait for serious follow-up work.


## Closing the Action-Analysis Loop

The system I've instituted is surprisingly successful despite not having done any design work.
It consists of keeping notes through the week, then transferring those into notes for the monthly review.
Those weekly notes --- which I was already doing --- are now not getting lost, and they go through an additional level of revision.
The other essential element is to read through my notes and ask questions of myself.
Seeing those questions in real-time means they can be a tool for fighting against problems as they occur.

Although the system is highly successful, I find that my notes are spread over several bits of paper.
As such, I'm trying to design a single notebook that can handle all my regular notes.
The actual design will be documented elsewhere.


## Writing

I've tried to write fiction before, but it would always suck;
I would later realize that it was a problem of voice.
I had never found my own writing voice, much less the voice of any characters.
I've begun consciously believing in the power of practice: the reason I'm any good at math is because of all the homework problems I did.
Of course, the only way for me to find my voice is to practice writing, and practice it a lot.
For some reason, that didn't really click with me until I started daily journaling at the end of this month.

The likely reason I've started journaling is because I've been listening to a lot of The Pen Addict podcast.
(That may also be the reason I've spent a lot of money on pens this month...)
Even so, it got me itching so hard to use a pen that there was no other way to scratch it than writing.
In short order, I decided to do twice-daily writing without reason.
There is intensionally no pressure to "succeed" in the writing: the end-goal is mere practice.
I've also limited myself to at most a page of ~A5 per entry, and I hope that will help me develop a concise, punchy style.

From all of this, I've found a reason to stay in the pen community.
It may be a reason in retrospect, but... I bought my pens not to enhance my writing experience, but to inspire me to write in the first place.



## Questions

  * **How do I recover more quickly after disruptions of routine?**
    If the system falls down when I am sick, is that an indication that it should be made easier (more accesible)?
    "the work is the inspiration"
  * **How can I utilize okuno.info better?**
    When making a day plan, always check okuno.info; same goes for regularly.
  * **Am I spending too much time in garbage collection?**
  * **Why am I using YouTube? Should I institute more restrictive procedures for using YouTube?**
    The reason I don't use Facebook is because (aside from their business practices) its algorithm is not optimized to keep me informed about what my friends are doing.
    YouTube's algorithm isn't really designed to teach me; on the other hand, I do have better control over it; how much control; on the gripping hand, it's still worth examining its value to me.
    So far, I think just knowing this question is there has helped me restrain my watch times.
  * **The stuff on my platter tends to get invisible; how do I fix that?**
  * **Is it a fluke that my recent analog obsession is cotemporal with having a lot of ideas?**
  * **When am I going to teach? It doesn't have to be a PhD, it could be video.**
    Learning screen capture, recording, & editing will be the only way I can teach in video.
    Like writing, the only way to learn this stuff will be to practice it.
    That said, I may take the time to work on my voice first.
  * **Are my discretionary purchases undergoing priority inversion?**
    I may need to sit down to really create a full list of them and budget accordingly.

This is not so much a question as a comment, but here it is:
Look at someone like Andrew Huang.
Sure, he's got a million subs, but without that, he's just a person doing creative things every day, and that's valuable in itself, at least as far as staving off the Absurd.


## Future

I have no better place to put my future plans at the moment.

  * I plan in February to document the development environments I use.
    In particular, I'm looking to identify gaps in my tooling.
    Also, it'd be nice to have a working Android development environment for when I want better apps on my phone, or custom notifications in my system.
  * There are several options available for vacation: Jeykll, Upper Peninsula, Valimir Arts corporate retreat, Christmas in Peru.
    I'll need to figure out my vacation budget and decide on some preferences.
    Also, learn at least a little Spanish.
  * How does the decentralized web work? What is Holochain?
  * I have a lot of writing I'd like to <del>do</del>have done about what programming is, and various techniques/paradigms/modes of use/architectural styles.
    Right now, the idea sketches are just piling up and I need to find a time to develop them.
    Summer is for development; perhaps that is the right time?

If (when) I go back to Japan, don't forget about Sengaku-ji!
