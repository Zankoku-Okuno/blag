# January 12018

This month started with low motivation, possibly as a result of the abnormal holiday schedule.
Nevertheless, I'd like to get "back on the wagon" more quickly after disruptions.
I think this may simply be a matter of practicing "the work is the inspiration".

I've noticed that now that I have a notebook and daily plan, I'm putting less stuff into the todo system.
The lack of interesting things in that system is likely hampering my ability to plan 
That is, I'd like to get back to the point of (usefully) checking the system to add things into my day plan.

I have a lot of writing I'd like to <del>do</del>have done about what programming is, and various techniques/paradigms/modes of use/architectural styles.
Right now, the idea sketches are just piling up and I need to find a time to develop them.
Summer is for development; perhaps that is the right time?

It came to my attention that although I have often heard and used the terms "abstract grammar" and "abstract syntax tree", most if not all descriptions of syntax I've seen discuss concrete syntax.
I thought it would be relatively easy to find some definitions of abstract syntax and abstract grammar in the literature, but I've yet to get a good foothold.
The best shot I've got is harper's PFPL Ch. 1, which does have a fairly clear description of ASTs, though not of abstract grammars.
That chapter also opens up the possibility of abstract binding trees, which I think will be necessary for automatic derivation of variable binding and substitution; unfortunately, I find Harper's ABTs too restrictive a grammar to model realistic calculi directly.
Instead, I may need to build my own definition of ABTs

The majority of the last two weeks has been building a bed (2 days), being sick (5 days), and wedding (1 day).
That said, I have managed to make some progress on abstract syntax.
In particular, I've found some references that I can build off of, and I've found a problem with those formalizations that I think I can solve.
The problem is how we can define variable-related operations (alpha-conversion, substitution, free variables, variables bound by a context) while accounting for complex binding structures (including letrec, pattern destructuring, multiple declaration/initialization statements, scope narrowing/exclusion) directly.

Taking notes alongside my research reading has been quite effective.
I expect I will continue the practice.
I may also blend it with a John Bartholemew[sp?] chess-analysis style two-pass system: a read-through, some notes about key points and feelings, then a detailed pass with note-taking.

I'm not using Facebook because (aside from their business practices) its algorithm is not optimized to keep me informed about what my friends are doing.
Why am I using YouTube?
I think I've got more control over YouTube's algorithm, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't re-examine it.

In the last week I've been listening to loads of The Pen Addict podcast.
At some point, it inspired an itch to write _so_ bad that I just had to stop what I was doing, get an old, half-used journal and start writing --- writing anything.
It eventually led to my instituting a twice-daily journal.

I've tried to write fiction before, but it would always suck;
I would later realize that it was a problem of voice.
I had never found my own writing voice, much less the voice of any characters.
I've begun consciously believing in the powerof practice: the reason I'm any good at math is because of all the homework problems I did.
Of course, the only way for me to find my voice is to practice writing, and practice it a lot.

It may be a reason in retrospect, but... I bought my pens not to enhance my writing experience, but to inspire me to write in the first place.

Questions:
  * How do I recover more quickly after disruptions of routine?
    If the system falls down when I am sick, is that an indication that it should be made easier (more accesible)?
  * How can I incentivize putting more interesting tasks into the todo system?
  * Am I spending too much time in garbage collection?
  * Why am I using YouTube? Should I institute more restrictive procedures for using YouTube?
  * The stuff on my platter tends to get invisible; how do I fix that?
