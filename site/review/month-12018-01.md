# January 12018

This month started with low motivation, possibly as a result of the abnormal holiday schedule.
Nevertheless, I'd like to get "back on the wagon" more quickly after disruptions.
I think this may simply be a matter of practicing "the work is the inspiration".

I've noticed that now that I have a notebook and daily plan, I'm putting less stuff into the todo system.
The lack of interesting things in that system is likely hampering my ability to plan 
That is, I'd like to get back to the point of (usefully) checking the system to add things into my day plan.

I have a lot of writing I'd like to <del>do</del>have done about what programming is, and various techniques/paradigms/modes of use/architectural styles.
Right now, the idea sketches are just piling up and I need to find a time to develop them.
Summer is for development; perhaps that is the right time?

It came to my attention that although I have often heard and used the terms "abstract grammar" and "abstract syntax tree", most if not all descriptions of syntax I've seen discuss concrete syntax.
I thought it would be relatively easy to find some definitions of abstract syntax and abstract grammar in the literature, but I've yet to get a good foothold.
The best shot I've got is harper's PFPL Ch. 1, which does have a fairly clear description of ASTs, though not of abstract grammars.
That chapter also opens up the possibility of abstract binding trees, which I think will be necessary for automatic derivation of variable binding and substitution; unfortunately, I find Harper's ABTs too restrictive a grammar to model realistic calculi directly.
Instead, I may need to build my own definition of ABTs


Questions:
  * How do I recover more quickly after disruptions of routine?
  * How can I incentivize putting more interesting tasks into the todo system?
