In Janurary, I met a man on the train who said I should be a teacher, and that leaving an impression on one's students is a blessing.
If you haven't given it thought, then it's quite natural to think about your gifts as something you have, but it's not true of course.
Your gifts are the things you give.

When I was a child, the joke was that I was a little professor.
My mom tells me a story about going to the museum once, and I couldn't help but talk about how you can tell saurischians from ornithischians by the shape of the hip bones.
Mom happened to glance backwards for something and only then noticed the other adults being amazed.
As long as I've been able to see it, I've loved the feeling of a lightbulb turning on in my head and watching the same thing happen in another's;
I've even been able to make that happen on occaision.
And besides, if I'm not going to have kids

All this to say that I need to get off my ass and actively pursue my PhD instead of jsut wish for it.

Sometimes, I'll think about being interviewed for a programming job, which could mean one of two things:
  * I'm trying to figure out how to explain to laymen the true (i.e. over-complex) nature of object-oriented programming.
  * I actually want a different job, and am prepping for the obvious questions I have non=obvious answers to.

I can express the choice whether to move jobs as between organization/challenge/money and known-good people & ability to slack.
There are plenty of reasons why switching is good: paying off my loans earlier, getting a broader & more rigorous experience, and seeing a real software company in action.
The thing keeping me where I am is that in the scheme of jobs it's a seriously good one; that, and there's a high activation energy for job hunting.
Even just that inertia is an indicator that it could be better to move.
