In Janurary, I met a man on the train who said I should be a teacher, and that leaving an impression on one's students is a blessing.
If you haven't given it thought, then it's quite natural to think about your gifts as something you have, but it's not true of course.
Your gifts are the things you give.

When I was a child, the joke was that I was a little professor.
My mom tells me a story about going to the museum once, and I couldn't help but talk about how you can tell saurischians from ornithischians by the shape of the hip bones.
Mom happened to glance backwards for something and only then noticed the other adults being amazed.
As long as I've been able to see it, I've loved the feeling of a lightbulb turning on in my head and watching the same thing happen in another's;
I've even been able to make that happen on occaision.
And besides, if I'm not going to have kids

All this to say that I need to get off my ass and actively pursue my PhD instead of jsut wish for it.
