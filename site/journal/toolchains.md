What environment(s) does the language get used in?
What is the particular niche of the language?
Are there major dialects?
What is the packaging system?
How are dependencies acquired and linked into a program?
How are packages distributed? Do packages tend to be source or binary?
Are there any particular advantages or disadvantages compared to other languages in the niche?
How do you test an artifact for
