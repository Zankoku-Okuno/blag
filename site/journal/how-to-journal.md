# How (and Why) to Journal

A piece of Bullet Journaling advice is to review the journal at least once in the morning and once in the evening.
A piece of Baha'i guidance is to pray and meditate at sunrise and sunset.
There's a wonderful convergence there, and possibly even a confluence if you can journal meditatively or meditate through journaling.
I don't think I'll personally find much confluence between the two, but the similarities tell me that this is a good idea.

I think I will try to institute a daily "writing" practice.
Every morning and evening I will write something. Anything, as long as I write it.
My goal is to fill most of --- but no more than --- one page of a notebook (about A5 or Traveller's notebook size).
The content could be anything, not even necessarily writing: perhaps I'll get the bug to draw something.
The content also won't be attempting quality, but will just be free expression without a worry for its future.

And if one day I wake up and can't think of anything to write, I will write "The reason for getting out of bed in the morning is to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning."
The solution to a blank page is to write on it, and that kind of idea can go so many places I should have no problem finding something from my life to follow on from it.

Between the blag and my daily journal, I'm doing a lot of writing, and it's ballooning my meta time taking care of it.
One way I could think about it is that the journal is spontaneous writing practice, whereas the blag is directed writing practice.
As such, I should be choosing goals for the blag, not simply garbage collecting everything into it, even if it "would make a good piece for the blag".
