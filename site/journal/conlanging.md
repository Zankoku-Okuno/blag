# Systems for Conlanging

It's not joke that after coming on the Conlangery Podcast, I have had zero success at conlanging.
Part of that is that I hd other things to do --- get a job, finish my masters degree, other hobbies --- but another part is that I have become acutely aware of the inadequacies of my organizational system for conlangs.
Now that I am always carrying a notebook with me, I am able to record conlang ideas at any time, which has helped, but without organization I'm worried that my efforts will collapse again.

## Pre-conscious Design

There was a mush of text documents, a couple word documents for reference, and possibly an excel file for the lexicon if I had gotten that far, and some examples spread across afew more word documents.
All of these were potentially desynch'd in complex ways, i.e. comparing two documents some parts might be ahead while others behind.


## Forcing Decisions

The prior system creates as an articat a Schr√∂dinger's text file of half-decisions, and from that only comes frustration, not a langauge.
I therefroe need to step up my ability to make a solid decision.
I'll also need some way to index those decisions to that I can relate new decisions to what has come before.

I can only be happy making a conlanging decision when I'm happy a choice will work well, and I can only have that when I can test my language in real sentences, and that requires a good lexicon.


## The Synching Problem

As I have learned from NewFields, the correct way to manage a large, complex body of work is to record the bare facts, then show all work leading to conclusions.
In the case of conlanging, the bare facts are (a) the lexicon and (b) innumerable decisions about the usual phonetic and grammatical patterns of the langauge.
The conclusion are texts and utterances.

The broadest strokes of tracking work is to simply record the dates when anything changes, then check & update all derived work whenever the bare facts change.
As a language grows, this becomes infeasible.
Therefore, we will need to track the which decisions and lexcal items went into a particular derived work.
If we can also ease the burden of performing updates (i.e. re-conjugating all words in sample texts based on a change to the inflectional morphology), that would be a massive help^[though possibly only an enhancement instead of a necessity; as the body of sample texts grows it may be a necessity].
