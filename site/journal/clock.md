# A Well-Tuned Clock

It seems that timing and cycles are important for humans to locate themselves in their time direction.
As such, I should design for myself a clock that suits my orientation in time and is attractive given my interests.

## Design

It should be a 24-hour clock, with noon at the top.
The existing 12-hour clocks make fitting blocks of time into a day difficult by rolling over during times when I am normally or often active.
A 24-hour clock will better allow me to approximate my time planning and usage day-to-day by simple visual inspection.

Years pass by unnoticed; this has to do with the lack of intuition in our linguistic notation for dates.
My clock should note the time of the year in a purely visual way: using a pointer travelling around a cycle.
The pre-existing art here is to use an ecliptic, as in an astrolabe.
This has the added benefit of my being able to visually estimate sunrise/sunset; note that daylight hours are an important consideration for some tasks.
I am interested in astronomical phenomena, so this astronomy addition is quite pleasing.
The clock will therefore require my latitude and information about daylight savings.

Knowing the weather is important on a daily basis to determine my carrying an umbrella and wearing coats.
If I know temperature, precipitation, and wind, I should be pretty good.
I haven't decided on actual temperature or adjusted for wind chill &c.

I've always wanted to learn stars but I don't have a good method.
Integrating a planisphere into the clock should do the trick.
If I'm ending up with a computer-clock, then I could also mark the planets, something which would be extreemly difficult in a mechanical clock.
Knowing the phase of the moon would also be cool.

The day of the week should be given, but I am undecided as to how to accomplish this visually instead of using day-of-week names.

In addition to visual estimation, the clock should allow detailed times to be known so as to better coordinate with other's or fixed schedules.
I have not explored methods for this, other than to integrate a standard clock as a smaller component.
If ever I end up collaborating across time zones, I'd like the ability to have more than one standard clock, each set to a different timezone.

There may also be some benefit in including a Baha'i calendar so I'm not so surprised by events.
