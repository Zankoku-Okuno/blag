# Analogital

> Analogital: adj. of or related to using both analog and digital tools in such a way that they reinforce and enhance each other.

Analog and digital tools _are_ very different, but neither is clearly better than the other.
Rather, they each have their own advantages & disadvantages in various situations which arise from their fundamental properties.

## Rules and Flexibility

The most obvious difference between the two is:
  * Analog is about stuff with blobs of other stuff stuck to it.
  * Digital is about enforced rules.

This difference means that analog is incredibly flexible.
It can support extraordinarily complex formats without balking.
This same flexibility means that it is completely unstructured, unchecked, and unautomatable.

It also means that digital allows computers to understand your work.
It can check your work so that you aren't entering skimwise-reasonable but factwise-nonsensical things like "2018-02-29".
This automation doesn't come for free however: someone needs to build the rules into the computer.
If what you need doesn't already exist, making it yourself can be a long and dangerous process.

## Moving Things

It is remarkably easy to move digital work around.
Analog work has to be moved manually.

Which of these is advantageous depends on how much you have to move, how often it needs to be moved, and how much attention you want to pay to the information being moved.

## Publishing

Digital is much easier to publish widely than analog, but analog can be published more deeply.

Analog publishing requires a printer &/ manufacturer: a very steep initial investment.
By contrast, digital requires merely an internet connection.
There are plenty of free platforms that can publish your work, or you can make your own at fairly low cost.

The other side of the coin is that sometimes it's _too_ easy to publish digital things.
Once something is on the internet, anyone might see it, keep it on display forever, and then everyone can discover it with search engines.
There's a disconnect between that fact and the feeling of ephemeral communication that social networks provide.
Until we've adapted to the facts of digital communication, that disconnect will continue to cause problems.

Oddly, analog artifacts tend to stick around longer than digital ones.
Archivists prize physical documents because they can last for hundreds or thousands of years and still be accessed.
The longevity of any of the multifarious digital formats is unproven.
In fact, there are plenty of formats from only a few decades ago that are now essentially unreadable.
That's because access to digital requires a massive, complex, fragile tower of technologies to be maintained: more than you will likely ever realize.
Access to analog requires only being in the same place as it.

When publishing, the thing to consider is the audience you want to reach, and the audience you _don't_ want to reach.
Analog and digital have significantly different audiences, but that's only the start of it.

## The Hybrids

In one sense, plain text files are some of the most restrictive formats available.
They only allow a single stream of text, and your character set is limited[^unicode].
On the other hand, plenty of data is text, and careful (manual) formatting of the contents can allow for automated processing while also allowing for normal reading by humans.
So in another sense, plain text is one of the most analog-like digital formats.

[^unicode]: Unicode does a pretty good job, but it won't let you write in e.g. Klingon script.
A proposal to add Klingon to Unicode failed because apparently everyone uses the romanization instead.
Well, maybe we _would_ use the script if there were some **uni**versal **code** that allowed us to use it?
That's okay; have fun decoding the Private Use Area in 20 years!

Perhaps the only more analog-like digital format is a digital image.
Unfortunately, digital image manipulation has a relatively big learning curve.
Between expensive products, awkward input methods, and limited apps, it takes serious effort to become proficient with digital image editing.
Even if you do manage it, the computer's ability to manipulate that information is limited to simple graphical adjustments rather than semantics-based processing^[unless you're _also_ a machine learning expert].
