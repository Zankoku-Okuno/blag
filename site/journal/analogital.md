# Analogital

> Analogital: adj. of or related to using both analog and digital tools in such a way that they reinforce and enhance each other.

Analog and digital tools _are_ very different, btu neither is clearly better than the other.
Rather, they each have their own advantages & disadvantages in various situations which arise from their fundamental properties.

## Rules and Flexibility

The most obvious difference between the two is:
  * Analog is about stuff with blobs of other stuff stuck to it.
  * Digital is about rules.

This difference means that analog is incredibly flexible.
It can support extraordinarily complex layouts without balking.
This same flexibility means that it is completely unstructured, unchecked, and unautomatable.

It also means that digital allows computers to understand your work.
It can check your work so that you aren't entering nonsensical things like "2018-02-29".
This automation doesn't come for free however: someone needs to build the automation into the computer in the first place, and if what you need doesn't already exist, it can be a long and dangerous process to make it.

## Moving Things

It is remarkably easy to move digital work around.
Analog work has to be moved manually.

Which of these is advantageous depends on how much you have to move, how often it needs to be moved, and how much attention you want to pay to the information being moved.
