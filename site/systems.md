# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Fundamentals/Theory

As with any dependency, let's be sure we first have an abstract understanding of our needs.
The specific tools, and also the roles they happen to fill, should be left until later.
This way, we'll be less likely to overfit our wants to the status-quo.
