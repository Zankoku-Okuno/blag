# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Fundamentals/Theory

As with any dependency, let's be sure we first have an abstract understanding of our needs.
The specific tools, and also the roles they happen to fill, should be left until later.
This way, we'll be less likely to overfit our wants to the status-quo.

  * time monitoring
      * regular cycles
      * usage
  * actions
      * prioritization/search
      * schedule
          * repeating events
          * fuzzy schedule
          * unscheduled
          * deadlines or scheduled with others
      * notification
  * planning
  * critical analysis/reflection/review
  * policy (incl. checklists, templates)
  * notes
      * morsels (quotes, puzzles, results, ...)
      * writing drafts
      * short-term vs. long-term
      * search
  * externalities (note what I'm ignoring)

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.
I want to live a life where my decisions become better.
Therefore, the design of my life should enable my decisions to become conscious where they were previously forced on me by my environment and habits.
Over time, those conscious decisions may become habits themselves, but hopefully better habits than before.
