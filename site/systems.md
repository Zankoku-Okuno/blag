# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I design and track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Some Guiding Inspiration

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.

A review is not just a list of accomplishments and shortcomings;
it is an opportunity to choose what to highlight.
The quality of that choice will affect the quality of further action.

If being an executive means not having anywhere else to pass the blame to, then the life of an executive is about making significant decisions, living with the outcomes, striving to make better choices, and not relying on luck or privilege.


## Fundamentals/Theory

As with any dependency, let's be sure we first have an abstract understanding of our needs.
The specific tools, and also the roles they happen to fill, should be left until later.
This way, we'll be less likely to overfit our wants to the status-quo.

Undortunately, I'm not sure I have enough experience to be able to create a good theory.

One possible theoretical framework is planning, reminders, and review (i.e. future, present, past).

### Biological Analogy

I'd like to use a method related to biological systems.
Unfortunately, I don't know enough about some of theses systems, and the realm of memetic systems is even less well-understood.
Nevertheless, here's a working list:

  * Biological Health (circulatory)
  * Reflection (prefrontal cortex)
  * Filtering (kidneys)
  * Planning and Prediction (brain)
  * Memetic Diet (hunting)
  * Taking Notes (digestion)
  * Drafts/Iteration (muscles)
  * Free Play (sleep)
  * Detecting Bias (immune)
  * Publishing (breeding)

There may be more, but this is what I have for now.

## Applied

  * reminders
      * waiting for robot to complete
      * appointment with someone/thing
      * regular tasks
      * checklists and templates
      * deadlines
  * timekeeping
  * timetracking
  * tasks repository
      * prioritization
      * search
      * schedule
      * dependencies
      * enhancers
  * planning
      * long-term goals
      * short-term (daily, weekly, &c)
      * predict time that will be spent^[timepretracking?]
  * critical analysis/reflection/review
      * idea filtering
      * principle extraction
      * mistakes to avoid
  * notes
      * morsels (quotes, puzzles, results, ...)
      * policy
      * writing drafts
      * short-term vs. long-term
      * search
  * externalities (note what I'm ignoring)
  * communication systems
  * organization
      * digital
      * physical space utilization

### Particular Forms of Notes

TODO: Writing tasks can't all be lumped together.
A small reminder is very different from a monthly review is very different from working on an academic article.
I therefore need to get some more experience of different writing forms and find out what kinds of systems might even be needed.
For now, I'm just brute-forcing is with the blag.

A number of writing- and academia-related stuff:

  * approach, i.e. design methodology
  * epigram or idea with citation
  * study/analysis notes
  * academic draft fragments
  * opinion
  * style guide
  * hypotheses
  * questions & proposed answers
  * puzzles
  * definitions/reference
  * reflection

## Current Systems

**Focus Lists**: TODO

**Yearly Themes**: Each year I write down questions that have come up in the past year.
The questions so far have been big questions --- essentially different forms of how best to manage a human life --- which humanity has been trying to answer for thousands of years with no clear answer.
I will likely not come to an answer myself --- at least not one I could convince anyone else of.
Therefore, I try to find good hypotheses; even if I can't articulate a good answer, hopefully a reader will be able to ask that question effectively in their own situation.
And anyways, asking the right questions is often far better than getting the right answers; Lorentz figured out the equations for how light works, but only when Einstein asked the right question did that answer make any sense.
Note that, unlike the Yearly Themes discusses on Cortex, my approach is not a prospective or focusing tool, but as an analytical one.



## Current Tools

  * okuno.info ---
        Task memory and prioritization.
        Underdeveloped w.r.t. searching tasks, scheduling tasks, and timetracking.
  * Regularly ---
        Repeating events.
  * Tomoe River Paper ---
        Daily planning.
  * Wall Calendar ---
        Qualitative, coarse-grained time tracking.
        Aids review tasks.
  * blag.okuno.info ---
        Brute-force solution to various review and notekeeping tasks.
  * Garbage Collection ---
        Regular idea filtering.
  * Wallet Notebook ---
        Short idea recording available at all tiems^[as long as I'm wearing pants].
        Further, it is external short-term memory^[the Field Notes-style "write it down to remember it now"].
  * Three-Ring Notebook ---
        Long-form idea recording.
  * Ideas Folder ---
        Supports Garbage Collection to filter programming ideas.
  * Github ---
        Long-term project storage.
        Could be more, but underutilized.
  * clock.okuno.info ---
        Timekeeping in regular cycles.
        Could be much more, but underdeveloped.
  * OK Timer ---
        Reminders to resume robot-blocked tasks.
  * Sort Folders ---
        Temporary holding for digital information before organization.

## Improvement

  * Better ways to search tasks:
    1. filter by size (e.g. I only have a little time vs. I can make progress on something large),
    2. dismiss a tag,
    3. attach an `x` button to action item descriptors that hides every item with that descriptor,
    4. button that resets all filters,
    5. view a project without activating it.
    
  * Reduce the number of things I have to do to get something into okuno.info:
    1. create new tags with a new action item,
    2. mission statement should be optional,
    3. get layout on the page to work on mobile.
    
  * Improved action item data:
    1. when putting an item into waiting mode, allow for a date to be set when the item will re-appear,
    2. allow monetary costs for items.
    
  * item dependencies
    
  * A system of review is fundamental to successful operation of any planning system.
    
  * Merge all email streams together.
    
  * Improve soundscape:
    1. organize music,
    2. review music on phone,
    3. obtain white noise/ambient music,
    4. optimize alarm sounds.
    
  * Seasonalism means to focus on different things through the year:
      * Spring to explore  --- learn new tools and generate new ideas
      * Summer to develop  --- adopt better tools and robustify existing artifacts
      * Autumn to analyze  --- take an inventory of tools and systems
      check systems, tools, & artifacts to see if they are working or not working and where they can be improved
      * Winter to organize --- take inventory of the ideas, plan their direction, and perform cleanup
    
  * Improved tooling for journaling, writing tutorials and essays:
    1. notes database,
    2. drafts technology or system,
    3. fundamentals of inscription.


## Notes on Tooling

Look at the "Things 3" app for a minimalist to-do system.

Scheduled tasks vs. travel: notifications must handle using timezoned time vs. local time intelligently.

The killer feature of to-do systems is to hide things that are not immediately actionable.
