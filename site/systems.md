# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I design and track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Some Guiding Inspiration

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.

A review is not just a list of accomplishments and shortcomings;
it is an opportunity to choose what highlight.
The quality of that choice will affect the quality of further action.

If being an executive means not having anywhere else to pass the blame to, then the life of an executive is about making significant decisions, living with the outcomes, striving to make better choices, and not relying on luck or privilege.


## Fundamentals/Theory

As with any dependency, let's be sure we first have an abstract understanding of our needs.
The specific tools, and also the roles they happen to fill, should be left until later.
This way, we'll be less likely to overfit our wants to the status-quo.

The method I'm going to use here employs analogy to biological systems.

  * Biological Health (circulatory)
  * Reflection (prefrontal cortex)
  * Filtering (kidneys)
  * Planning and Prediction (brain)
  * Memetic Diet (hunting)
  * Taking Notes (digestion)
  * Drafts/Iteration (muscles)
  * Free Play (sleep)
  * Detecting Bias (immune)
  * Publishing (breeding)

There may be more, but this is what I have for now.

### Applied

The more I think about the following list, the more I think it's less theoretical.

  * reminders
      * waiting for robot to complete
      * appointment with someone/thing
      * regular tasks
      * checklists and templates
      * deadlines
  * timekeeping
  * timetracking
  * tasks repository
      * prioritization
      * search
      * schedule
      * dependencies
      * enhancers
  * planning
      * long-term goals
      * short-term (daily, weekly, &c)
      * predict time that will be spent^[timepretracking?]
  * critical analysis/reflection/review
      * idea filtering
      * principle extraction
      * mistakes to avoid
  * [notes](#Particular_Things_to_Keep_50)
      * morsels (quotes, puzzles, results, ...)
      * policy
      * writing drafts
      * short-term vs. long-term
      * search
  * externalities (note what I'm ignoring)
  * communication systems
  * organization
      * digital
      * physical space utilization

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.
I want to live a life where my decisions become better.
Therefore, the design of my life should enable my decisions to become conscious where they were previously forced on me by my environment and habits.
Over time, those conscious decisions may become habits themselves, but hopefully better habits than before.

## Current Tools

  * okuno.info ---
        Task memory and prioritization.
        Underdeveloped w.r.t. searching tasks, scheduling tasks, and timetracking.
  * Regularly ---
        Repeating events.
  * Tomoe River Paper ---
        Daily planning.
  * Wall Calendar ---
        Qualitative, coarse-grained time tracking.
        Aids review tasks.
  * blag.okuno.info ---
        Brute-force solution to various review and notekeeping tasks.
  * Garbage Collection ---
        Regular idea filtering.
  * Wallet Notebook ---
        Short idea recording available at all tiems^[as long as I'm wearing pants].
        Further, it is external short-term memory^[the Field Notes-style "write it down to remember it now"].
  * Three-Ring Notebook ---
        Long-form idea recording.
  * Ideas Folder ---
        Supports Garbage Collection to filter programming ideas.
  * Github ---
        Long-term project storage.
        Could be more, but underutilized.
  * clock.okuno.info ---
        Timekeeping in regular cycles.
        Could be much more, but underdeveloped.
  * OK Timer ---
        Reminders to resume robot-blocked tasks.
  * Sort Folders ---
        Temporary holding for digital information before organization.

## Improvement

  * Better ways to search tasks:
    1. filter by size (e.g. I only have a little time vs. I can make progress on something large),
    2. dismiss a tag,
    3. attach an `x` button to action item descriptors that hides every item with that descriptor,
    4. button that resets all filters,
    5. view a project without activating it.
    
  * Reduce the number of things I have to do to get something into okuno.info:
    1. create new tags with a new action item,
    2. mission statement should be optional,
    3. get layout on the page to work on mobile.
    
  * Improved action item data:
    1. when putting an item into waiting mode, allow for a date to be set when the item will re-appear,
    2. allow monetary costs for items.
    
  * item dependencies
    
  * A system of review is fundamental to successful operation of any planning system.
    
  * Merge all email streams together.
    
  * Improve soundscape:
    1. organize music,
    2. review music on phone,
    3. obtain white noise/ambient music,
    4. optimize alarm sounds.
    
  * Seasonalism means to focus on different things through the year:
      * Spring to explore  --- learn new tools and generate new ideas
      * Summer to develop  --- adopt better tools and robustify existing artifacts
      * Autumn to analyze  --- take an inventory of tools and systems
      check systems, tools, & artifacts to see if they are working or not working and where they can be improved
      * Winter to organize --- take inventory of the ideas, plan their direction, and perform cleanup
    
  * Improved tooling for journaling, writing tutorials and essays:
    1. notes database,
    2. drafts technology or system,
    3. fundamentals of inscription.

## Particular Forms of Notes

TODO: Writing tasks can't all be lumped together.
A small reminder is very different from a monthly review is very different from working on an academic article.
I therefore need to get some more experience of different writing forms and find out what kinds of systems might even be needed.
For now, I'm just brute-forcing is with the blag.

A number of writing- and academia-related stuff:

  * approach, i.e. design methodology
  * epigram or idea with citation
  * study/analysis notes
  * academic draft fragments
  * opinion
  * style guide
  * hypotheses
  * questions & proposed answers
  * puzzles
  * definitions/reference
  * reflection

## Notes on Tooling

Look at the "Things 3" app for a minimalist to-do system.

Scheduled tasks vs. travel: notifications must handle using timezoned time vs. local time intelligently.

The killer feature of to-do systems is to hide things that are not immediately actionable.
