# Sir, We Have a System

This is where I design and track the methods of my life organization.
It includes the tools I use, the functions they perform, and areas that may need improvement.

## Fundamentals/Theory

As with any dependency, let's be sure we first have an abstract understanding of our needs.
The specific tools, and also the roles they happen to fill, should be left until later.
This way, we'll be less likely to overfit our wants to the status-quo.

  * time monitoring
      * regular cycles
      * usage
  * actions
      * prioritization/search
      * schedule
          * repeating events
          * fuzzy schedule
          * unscheduled
          * deadlines or scheduled with others
      * notification
  * planning
  * critical analysis/reflection/review
      * idea filtering
      * principle extraction
      * mistakes to avoid
  * policy (incl. checklists, templates)
  * [notes](#Particular_Things_to_Keep_50)
      * morsels (quotes, puzzles, results, ...)
      * writing drafts
      * short-term vs. long-term
      * search
  * externalities (note what I'm ignoring)
  * communication systems

The purpose of a human life is to design a life it wants to live.
I want to live a life where my decisions become better.
Therefore, the design of my life should enable my decisions to become conscious where they were previously forced on me by my environment and habits.
Over time, those conscious decisions may become habits themselves, but hopefully better habits than before.

## Current Tools

  * Wallet Notebook --- 
  * Three-Ring Notebook --- 
  * okuno.info --- 
  * Regularly --- 
  * Tomoe River Paper --- 
  * Ideas Folder --- 
  * Github --- 
  * Simple Timer --- 
  * Sort Folders --- 
  * blag.okuno.info --- 
  * clock.okuno.info --- 
  * Garbage Collection --- 

## Improvement

  * Reduce the number of things I have to do to get something into okuno.info:
    1. create new tags with a new action item,
    2. mission statement should be optional,
    3. get layout on the page to work on mobile.
    
  * Better ways to filter:
    1. filter by size (e.g. I only have a little time vs. I can make progress on something large),
    2. dismiss a tag,
    3. attach an `x` button to action item descriptors that hides every item with that descriptor,
    4. button that resets all filters,
    5. view a project without activating it.
    
  * Improved action item data:
    1. when putting an item into waiting mode, allow for a date to be set when the item will re-appear,
    2. allow monetary costs for items.
    
  * item dependencies
    
  * A system of review is fundamental to successful operation of any planning system.
    
  * Merge all email streams together.
    
  * Improve soundscape:
    1. organize music,
    2. review music on phone,
    3. obtain white noise/ambient music,
    4. optimize alarm sounds.
    
  * Seasonalism means to focus on different things through the year:
      * Spring to explore  --- learn new tools and generate new ideas
      * Summer to develop  --- adopt better tools and robustify existing artifacts
      * Autumn to analyze  --- take an inventory of tools and systems
      check systems, tools, & artifacts to see if they are working or not working and where they can be improved
      * Winter to organize --- take inventory of the ideas, plan their direction, and perform cleanup
    
  * Improved tooling for journaling, writing tutorials and essays:
    1. notes database,
    2. drafts technology or system,
    3. fundamentals of inscription.

## Particular Forms of Notes

A number of writing- and academia-related stuff:

  * approach, i.e. design methodology
  * epigram or idea with citation
  * study/analysis notes
  * academic draft fragments
  * opinion
  * style guide
  * hypotheses
  * questions & proposed answers
  * puzzles
  * definitions/reference
  * reflection
