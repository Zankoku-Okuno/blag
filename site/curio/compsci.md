A cheap programmer costs 10$ every 15-20 minutes.
I pay 10$ a month for hosting.
Programmer time is about two hundered times more expensive than computer time.
So, don't spend more than about a 40-hour workweek on optimization unless you're saving at least a year of compute time (okay... or if low latency is a requirement).
Disclaimer: this rule of thumb subject to change over time and with technology.

Solutions to systems of linear equations can have 0, 1, or infinitely many solutions --- just like the only numbers in computer science are 0, 1, & infinity.

There is no agreed-on way to represent why a client error occurred and what could be done about it.
The lack of a standard hurts discoverability, but there are some people working on this.
