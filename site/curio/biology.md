# Genetic Engineering

I once guessed that, like the arc of personal computing, genetic engineering would eventually make its way from multinational corporations and state actors down into the home: personal genetic engineering on your desktop.
Just like personal computers chaged the world, personal GE could do the same, but on an even grander scale as we each build our own personal self-replicating fleet of microscopic machines.

I've now found a [DIY CRISPR Kit](http://www.the-odin.com/diy-crispr-kit/).
This is exactly the path of the first build-it-yourself computers for hobbyists.
I am suddenly filled with both wonder and existential dread.
Is there a word for this feeling?; there should be.
