## Infinite Shapes

Skew Apierohedra have a "sponge"-like structure.
They tile space, partitioning it into two regions, and those two regions have the same topology.
Compare to filling space with bubbles, in which the voids have a very different topology from the soap films.
It turns out that the topology of the universe is sponge-like in exactly this way: galaxies and voids have the same topology.
