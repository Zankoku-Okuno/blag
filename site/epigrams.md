[^compositionality]: Principle of compositionality is that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent subexpressions.
The compatibility closure is fundamentally motivated by this principle.

Composition is combining things in a way that allows you to further combine them.
Further, it should be impossible to distinguish a combined object of interest from a primitive one without violating an abstraction boundary.

### On Design

Every creation has a design implicit in it, intentional or not.

All programming languages have types:
  * Python: `None()` → `TypeError`
  * Javascript: `null()` → `TypeError`

"Cobble & paste"

### Miscellaneous

The reason "No Man's Sky" failed^[i.e. its environments were boring] is because cryptography is hard.
