## Harsh Definitions

### Living

Automation is the art of being in two places at once.

Professionalism is outrunning the bear, even when you could just outrun the other campers.

Minimalism:
  * in design: Adding functionality by removing features.
  * in life: Remembering to poop.

An adult is a sentience that is able to reliably make choices about themself and their future light cone.
A child is in training to become an adult.
A monkey doesn't get why choices are such a big deal and just wants to get back to eating its banana.

### Epistemology

Belief is the assertion of a probability of truth.

### Semantics

> What a man means by a term is to be found by observing what he does with it, not by what he says about it.
>
> --- Percy W. Bridgeman

A semantics is an equivalence theory subject to the principle of compositionality[^compositionality].

[^compositionality]: Principle of compositionality is that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent subexpressions.
The compatibility closure is fundamentally motivated by this principle.

Composition is combining things in a way that allows you to further combine them.
Further, it should be impossible to distinguish a combined object of interest from a primitive one without violating an abstraction boundary.


### Economy

Online advertising is there to support sites that don't have enough investment from either the owners or the users.

SABLE: Stash Acquisition Beyond Life Expectancy.

Time is the only resource which is not only isn't renewable, but you can't even get any more after you've exhausted the local supply --- you're just dead at that point.

Minimalism in economics: "Your money is worth more if you have less of it"^[I.e. the marginal value of money to a rich person is not very high. I suppose the marginal value to civilization of money in the hands of the very poor is also not that good; if the money isn't doing more that keeping that person alive, then it's not growing civilization. Nevertheless, in the case of essentially every college-educated American, the epigram holds.].

### Programming

> Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where "significant" is measured by the cost of change.

> --- Grady Booch

> Computer science is the most difficult branch of applied mathematics.
>
> Edsger Dijkstra

Molecular biology is the most difficult branch of computer science.

### Design

Visual design --- perhaps all of aesthetics --- is the the application of the theory of cooperative games where the goal is to direct attention.

Every "yes" you say is an implied "no" to all the other things you could have done: that's opportunity cost.
Needs are wants that, if you say "no" to them, you are also saying "no" by implication to more than the usual number of other things.

If you have "noise" in your measurements of a complex physical system over time, try to run a Fourier analysis.
Perhaps the noise is actually internal structure.
See videos [What Do Stars Sound Like?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWyuJYybMA) and [Dominoes - HARDCORE Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPIobthvHg).

The world is much better modelled by the real numbers than by booleans.

When I attempt a vague problem, my method has been: 1) ask some questions, then 2) try something.

### On Design

Every creation has a design implicit in it, intentional or not.

### On Programming

Code that varies together should stay together.
Code that varies separately should stay separate.

Visualizing code in one's head is as important to programmers as visualizing positions is to chess players.

All programming languages have types:
  * Python: `None()` → `TypeError`
  * Javascript: `null()` → `TypeError`

If you had to do a _deep_ clone, then you were using the wrong data structure to begin with: one with too much mutable state.

When declarations are first class, metaprogramming isn't anymore.

There are only two places to use strings, and they're both unvalidated input:
you recieve a string, or
someone gets a string from you.

Every identifier has a scope wherin it is unique.
If the scope is not mentioned in the specification of an id, confusion is going to happen.

### Miscellaneous

The reason "No Man's Sky" failed^[i.e. its environments were boring] is because cryptography is hard.

I remember a moment when I was six and was being taught how to raed clocks: I was so proud that I had figured out why it was called the "second" hand instead of the third hand. "It's because it counts seconds!"
