## Harsh Definitions

### Living

Professionalism is outrunning the bear, even when you could just outrun the other campers.

Automation is the art of being in two places at once.

### Epistemology

Belief is the assertion of a probability of truth.

### Semantics

A semantics is an equivalence theory subject to the principle of compositionality[^compositionality].

[^compositionality]: Principle of compositionality is that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions.
The compatibility closure is fundamentally motivated by this principle.

Composition is combining things in a way that allows you to further combine them.
Further, it should be impossible to distinguish a combined object of interest from a primitive one without violating an abstraction boundary.


### Economy

Online advertising is there to support sites that don't have enough investment from either the owners or the users.

Every "yes" you say is an implied "no" to all the other things you could have done: that's opportunity cost.
Needs are wants that, if you say "no" to them, you are also saying "no" by implication to more than the usual number of other things.

If you have "noise" in your measurements of a complex physical system over time, try to run a Fourier analysis.
Perhaps the noise is actually internal structure.
See videos [What Do Stars Sound Like?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWyuJYybMA) and [Dominoes - HARDCORE Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPIobthvHg).

The world is much better modelled by the real numbers than by booleans.

### On Programming

Code that varies together should stay together.
Code that varies separately should stay separate.

Visualizing code in one's head is as important to programmers as visualizing positions is to chess players.

All programming languages have types:
  * Python: `None()` → `TypeError`
  * Javascript: `null()` → `TypeError`

If you had to do a _deep_ clone, then you were using the wrong data structure to begin with: one with too much mutable state.

When declarations are first class, metaprogramming isn't anymore.

### Miscellaneous

The reason "No Man's Sky" failed^[i.e. its environments were boring] is because cryptography is hard.
