## Flying with Pens

[Doug Lane's advice](http://micro.douglane.com/2014/09/02/flying-with-fountain.html) is quite thorough.
Also, Brian of Pen Goulet says that it's pretty easy to fly with your pens: get a good fill in a converter pen, takeoff with nib up, and you'll probably be good.
He's apparently also tried to get a leak and failed.

## Specific Pens

The Pilot Murex is an awesome pen, and the only vintage pen I care to own at the moment.
Someone has [some good nerdiness](http://www.stutler.cc/pens/murex/index.html) about the Murex and its short form the Myu.
