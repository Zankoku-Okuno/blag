# How to Story

My uncle studied literature, owned a bookstore, and teaches English.
When talking about what we each read, I admitted to him that I had never read a book for its literary value; I've enjoyed books and high literatrue, but never understood it like a student of the art.
His reaction I'll never forget: I knew at that moment that there was something missing in my life, but I had no idea how to solve it.

## Resources

After a year of watching film analysis videos, I think I might be finally starting to get it.
The feeling is amazing, so I'm starting a list of the places where I get that feeling.

## Notes

I've always suspected that any story can be analyzed into any structure if you try hard enough.
As any good scientist, I instantly recognized that these analyses are not good scientific theories.
But!, what if narrative analysis weren't about science, but about having a selection of methods that authors can use to organize their narrative thought in a way that works for them.
I'm not giving up on my hope for a science of literature, but at least I now know why narrative analysis had never clicked with me before.
